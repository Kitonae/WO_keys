## Compositions

<!-- STUB: This article should cover WATCHOUT's composition system — the ability to group cues into reusable, nested timeline units that behave as a single entity. -->

### Content to include

- **What compositions are** — explain that compositions are nested timelines created by grouping multiple cues together. A composition appears as a single cue on its parent timeline but internally contains its own layers, cues, and timing.
- **Creating a composition** — select multiple cues and use Timeline → Group Cues into Composition (Ctrl+G). Describe what happens to the selected cues and how the composition cue is created.
- **Ungrouping** — how to dissolve a composition back into individual cues using Ctrl+Shift+G.
- **Editing a composition** — double-clicking or right-clicking to open a composition for editing. Explain the composition editing mode indicator on the Stage and the restriction that projector mode is not available while editing a composition.
- **Composition properties** — name, duration, and how the composition's internal timeline relates to its parent's timing.
- **Compositions as assets** — explain that compositions appear in the asset types and can be reused across timelines.
- **Nesting** — whether compositions can contain other compositions and any depth limitations.
- **Stage behavior** — the "Composition mode is active" indicator and how the Stage filters to show only cues from the active composition.
- **Best practices** — when to group (stable, reusable clusters), naming conventions, and avoiding excessive regrouping late in production.
