## Corner Pinning

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Corners tween group, which allows distorting a cue's shape by independently moving its four corners. -->

### Content to include

- **What corner pinning is** — explain that the Corners tween allows you to independently move each of the four corners of a media cue, creating perspective distortion, trapezoid correction, or other quadrilateral deformations.
- **Corner tween channels** — list all 8 channels: Corner Top Left X/Y, Corner Top Right X/Y, Corner Bottom Left X/Y, Corner Bottom Right X/Y. Explain that values are expressed as offsets from the default corner positions.
- **Adding corner tweens** — how to add corner keyframes to a cue, either from the Tween menu or by right-clicking.
- **Animating corners** — using tween points to animate corner positions over time with easing curves, enabling dynamic perspective shifts.
- **Use cases** — mapping content onto non-rectangular surfaces, creating perspective effects, compensating for physical misalignment, and artistic distortion effects.
- **Interaction with warp geometry** — clarify that corner pinning is a per-cue effect applied before display-level warp geometry, and how the two can complement each other.
