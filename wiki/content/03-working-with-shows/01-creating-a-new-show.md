## Creating a New Show

Start a new project from scratch:

- Go to **File → New** or press `Ctrl+N`

- If you have unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save first

- A blank show opens with default settings

### Show File Location

Choose a location for your show file that's accessible from all computers in your setup. Consider using a shared network drive for multi-user projects.
