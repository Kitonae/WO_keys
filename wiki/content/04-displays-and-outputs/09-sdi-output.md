## SDI Output

<!-- STUB: This article should cover SDI (Serial Digital Interface) output configuration for displays. -->

### Content to include

- **SDI output type** — explain SDI as a display output type alongside GPU and NDI, and when to choose SDI.
- **SDI link types** — describe the available SDI link type settings (single link, dual link, quad link) and their bandwidth/resolution implications.
- **Channel assignment** — how to assign an SDI output channel on the target node's hardware.
- **Color depth and color space** — SDI-specific color depth options and supported color spaces.
- **Genlock** — how SDI genlock synchronizes frame output to an external reference signal. Reference the SDI Genlock show property and explain how it interacts with display-level settings.
- **Frame delay** — the per-display frame delay setting (up to 10 frames) for compensating processing latency in downstream equipment.
- **Interlaced output** — the interlaced mode toggle and when to use it for broadcast-oriented workflows.
- **Hardware requirements** — supported SDI capture/output cards (Deltacast, etc.) and driver considerations.
