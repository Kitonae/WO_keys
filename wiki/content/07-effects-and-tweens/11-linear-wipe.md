## Linear Wipe

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Linear Wipe tween effect, which progressively reveals or hides a cue using a straight-line wipe transition. -->

### Content to include

- **What linear wipe is** — a transition effect that reveals or hides content using a moving edge/boundary, defined by angle, position, and feather softness.
- **Wipe tween channels** — describe the four parameters:
  - **Angle** — the direction of the wipe edge (0–360 degrees).
  - **Location** — the position of the wipe edge along the wipe axis.
  - **Feather** — the softness/width of the transition zone at the wipe edge.
  - **Completion** — the overall progress of the wipe (0 = fully hidden, 1 = fully visible).
- **Creating a linear wipe** — how to add wipe tween keyframes to a cue.
- **Animating the wipe** — using tween points to animate wipe parameters over time for reveal/conceal transitions.
- **Combining with other effects** — using linear wipe together with opacity, position, and other tweens for complex transition sequences.
- **Use cases** — scene transitions, progressive content reveals, split-screen effects, and dynamic content boundaries.
