## File Operations

These are the primary default shortcuts for show-file work.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open show |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Save As |

### Notes

- Some file actions (for example **Save Copy**, **Open from Director**) are menu-only.
- On macOS builds, `Cmd` is used where `Ctrl` is shown.
