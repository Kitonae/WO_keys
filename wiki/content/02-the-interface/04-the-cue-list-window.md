## The Cue List Window

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Cue List window — a flat, filterable table view of all cues across the show, complementing the graphical Timeline view. -->

### Content to include

- **Opening the Cue List** — how to open the window from the Window menu and how it relates to the Timeline window.
- **Column layout** — describe available columns: Timeline, Name, Type, Start, Duration, Countdown, Source, Image (thumbnail), and Cue Set.
- **Choosing visible columns** — explain the column chooser and how to show/hide columns.
- **Sorting** — how clicking column headers cycles through ascending, descending, and no-sort (flat vs. tree view behavior).
- **Filtering** — the filter panel with options to include by cue kind (Media, Control, Output, Variable, Marker), media source type (Assets, Virtual Displays, Compositions, Captures), and the "Follow Selected" feature that synchronizes the list with selections in the Assets, Timelines, or Captures windows.
- **Filter presets** — saving, loading, updating, and deleting named filter presets for quick recall.
- **Selecting cues** — how selection in the Cue List reflects in the Timeline and Properties panel, and vice versa.
- **Blind Edit from Cue List** — how to enter Blind Edit mode for a timeline directly from the cue list.
- **Locking and unlocking cues** — lock/unlock individual or multiple selected cues from the list context.
- **Opening compositions** — right-click to open a composition cue for editing.
