## Test Patterns

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the built-in test pattern feature for display devices. -->

### Content to include

- **What test patterns are** — built-in diagnostic patterns rendered directly by the Runner on a display, independent of show content.
- **Accessing test patterns** — how to activate test patterns from device properties (the Test Pattern page).
- **Available patterns** — describe the types of test patterns available (grid, color bars, gradient, solid colors, etc.) and what each is useful for diagnosing.
- **Use cases** — verifying display alignment, checking color accuracy, confirming signal routing, diagnosing warp/mask geometry, and validating resolution and aspect ratio.
- **Interaction with show playback** — clarify whether test patterns overlay or replace show content and how to disable them.
