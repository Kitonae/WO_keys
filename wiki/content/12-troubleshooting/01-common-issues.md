## Common Issues

This section covers high-frequency problems seen during setup and rehearsal.

### Producer Opens but Show Actions Fail

Check:

- Director connection state
- Asset Manager connection state
- Whether a different show is currently active on the selected Director

### Cannot Open/Override Show on Director

- Verify you selected the intended host alias.
- Confirm team coordination before overriding a running Director show.
- Resolve unsaved local changes first if prompts are blocking action.

### Menus/Shortcuts Not Acting as Expected

- Confirm the intended window has focus.
- Check selection context (timeline, cue, layer, properties).
- Re-try command from menu to verify availability state.

### Startup Reliability Tips

- Keep node aliases stable.
- Avoid running unrelated heavy software on playback nodes.
- Reboot and validate nodes before show day if system state is uncertain.
