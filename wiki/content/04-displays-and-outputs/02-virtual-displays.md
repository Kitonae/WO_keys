## Virtual Displays

A virtual display behaves like a normal display in the Stage and Timeline, but it is not tied to a physical connector. It is useful for design, planning, and previsualization.

### When to Use Virtual Displays

Use virtual displays when you need to:

- Design content before hardware is on site
- Build a stage map for client review
- Prepare layout/animation while waiting for final routing details
- Simulate a complete system on a laptop or single workstation

### How They Behave

Virtual displays support standard workflow operations:

- Cue placement and stacking
- Tween animation
- Timeline playback preview
- Grouping and composition work

### Transitioning to Physical Outputs

When hardware is ready:

1. Replace virtual targets with GPU/SDI/NDI outputs as needed.
2. Set host address and channel routing.
3. Validate resolution, frame rate, and color settings.

### Best Practice

Keep a naming convention that distinguishes virtual from physical targets, for example:

- `VIRT_MainWall`
- `VIRT_SideScreen_R`

This avoids routing mistakes during deployment.
