## Position and Movement

Position tweens animate where a cue appears on Stage over time.

### Add Position Animation

Use **Position** tween actions (menu or shortcut `Alt+P`) on selected cues.

### Typical Uses

- Slide-ins and exits
- Object tracking across LED canvases
- Camera-like pan effects with layered content

### Precision Tools

- Add points directly on tween curves for key moments.
- Combine with cue start/duration edits for exact synchronization.
- Use nudge commands for fine stage-space adjustments.

### Best Practices

- Animate on one axis first, then add secondary motion.
- Keep movement curves simple for repeatable live operation.
