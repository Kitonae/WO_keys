Designed for show creators, live event professionals, and system integrators, WATCHOUT empowers you to orchestrate massive-scale visuals across unlimited displays, projectors, and LED walls—all from a single timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are creating a digital signage installation, a projection mapping spectacle, a live concert background, or a corporate presentation, WATCHOUT provides the tools to compose, manage, and play back high-resolution media with frame-accurate synchronization.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>New in WATCHOUT 7:</strong> This version introduces a completely new high-performance video engine, <strong>HDR</strong> (High Dynamic Range) support, and a modernized user interface with dark mode, asset management, and collaborative workflows.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>The Core Concept: One Giant Canvas</h3>\n\n<p>If you are new to multi-display systems, the easiest way to understand WATCHOUT is to think of it as <strong>one giant digital canvas</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In traditional systems with a ten-screen video wall, you might need ten separate video files and players. WATCHOUT eliminates this complexity.</p>\n\n<p>With WATCHOUT, you place your media on a <strong>Stage</strong>—a continuous workspace representing your entire display area. You can drag a video across all screens or animate an image from one side to the other. The system treats the entire display arrangement as a unified creative space.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, WATCHOUT handles the processing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Producer:</strong> You use the <strong>Producer</strong> software to design your show, arrange media on the Timeline, and animate content.</li>\n<li><strong>Display Computers:</strong> These computers connect to your projectors or LED walls and render the content.</li>\n<li><strong>The Playback:</strong> When you run your show, WATCHOUT automatically slices your content in real-time, sending the correct portion to each Display Computer. All computers play in perfect synchronization, creating a seamless image.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>System Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT uses a distributed client-server architecture designed for reliability and scalability.</p>\n\n<img src=\"../media/system_architecture_diagram.svg\" alt=\"WATCHOUT System Architecture Diagram\" class=\"content-image\">\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Production Computer:</strong> Runs the <strong>Producer</strong> software and manages your project files. This is your creative workstation where you organize content using the <strong>Asset Manager</strong>. It sends control commands (Play, Pause, Update) to the network while leaving heavy rendering to the display computers.</li>\n<li><strong>Display Computers:</strong> Run the <strong>Display</strong> software (formerly Watchpoint). These machines handle video decoding, real-time compositing, and rendering. Each Display Computer synchronizes automatically with the Production Computer and can run \"headless\" (without a monitor).</li>\n<li><strong>Network:</strong> Connects your Production and Display computers via standard Ethernet.</li>\n\n</ol>\nThis architecture allows you to scale from a simple two-screen setup to hundreds of outputs without changing your workflow.\n\n<h3>What You Can Create</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT is a blank canvas limited only by your hardware and imagination. Common applications include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wide-screen Projection:</strong> Blends multiple projectors to form massive panoramic screens.</li>\n<li><strong>Projection Mapping:</strong> Wraps video content around complex 3D objects or buildings.</li>\n<li><strong>LED Video Walls:</strong> Drives custom-resolution LED processors with pixel-perfect accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital Signage:</strong> Synchronizes playback across multiple monitors throughout a venue.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Broadcasts:</strong> Provides dynamic backdrops and lower-thirds for broadcast or streaming.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactive Installations:</strong> Triggers content based on external inputs from sensors, buttons, or network commands.</li>\n\n</ul>\nThe system adapts to your creative vision, whether you are designing an intimate gallery experience or a stadium concert.",
      "System Requirements": "<div class=\"article-metadata\"><span class=\"article-status status-content-verified\">Status: content verified - ready to edit</span><span class=\"article-author-badge\">Author: Karol</span><span class=\"article-editor-badge\">Editor: Jacquie</span><span class=\"article-qc-badge\">Quality Check: Miro</span><span class=\"article-date-badge\">Last Edit: 2026-02-09</span><a href=\"[[RELATIVE_PATH]]content/01-getting-started/02-system-requirements.md\" class=\"article-source-badge\" download>Source MD</a></div><h2>System Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 requires a Windows-based computer with modern hardware to deliver optimal performance. The requirements differ between the Producer computer (where you edit shows) and Display computers (which render and output to projectors/screens).</p>\n\n<h3>Producer vs. Display Computer Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT uses a <strong>client-server architecture</strong> that separates show creation from show playback:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Producer Computer</strong> – This is your creative workstation where you design, edit, and control shows. The Producer software provides the timeline editor, stage view, and all creative tools. You only need <em>one</em> Producer computer per show, and it doesn't need to be connected to any physical outputs—it can preview everything internally. The Producer sends commands and media to Display computers over the network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Display Computer(s)</strong> – These are dedicated playback machines that render content and drive physical outputs (projectors, LED walls, monitors). Each Display computer runs the WATCHOUT Display software and connects to your actual screens. A single Display computer can drive up to 4-8 outputs depending on the graphics card. For larger installations, you simply add more Display computers—WATCHOUT synchronizes them frame-accurately over the network.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can run both Producer and Display on the same computer for small setups or previewing. For production environments, dedicated Display computers ensure reliable, uninterrupted playback.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Producer Computer (Editing)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 10 21H2 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 23H2 or newer (64-bit)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i3/i5 or AMD Ryzen 3/5</td><td>Intel Core i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GiB DDR4</td><td>32 GiB DDR5 or more</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Graphics</td><td>DirectX 12 compatible GPU with 4 GiB VRAM</td><td>NVIDIA RTX PRO</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storage</td><td>SSD with 100 GiB free</td><td>NVMe SSD (Gen4) with 1 TiB+ free</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Network</td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td><td>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Display Computer (Playback)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 10 21H2 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 23H2 or newer (64-bit)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i3/i5, AMD Ryzen 3/5, or equivalent Xeon/EPYC</td><td>Intel Core i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 7/9, or equivalent Xeon/EPYC</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GiB DDR4</td><td>32 GiB DDR5 or more</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Graphics</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX</td><td>NVIDIA RTX PRO</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storage</td><td>SATA SSD (500+ MiB/s sustained read)</td><td>NVMe SSD (Gen4, 3500+ MiB/s sustained read)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Network</td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td><td>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note on CPU:</strong> The processor is not a critical factor for most WATCHOUT installations. Workstation-class processors like Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC work well, and even an Intel Core i3 provides sufficient performance for basic playback scenarios.\n</p></div>\n\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Note on AMD Graphics:</strong> While AMD GPUs may work, NVIDIA is recommended for full WATCHOUT feature support. AMD graphics cards require additional testing before deployment in production environments.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Windows Editions: Consumer vs. WATCHPAX</h3>\n\n<p>When building your own display computer, you'll use standard consumer Windows editions. <strong>Windows 11 Home</strong> or <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> are the recommended options for user-built systems.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Windows 11 Home/Pro</th><th>WATCHPAX</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Standard Windows</td><td>Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Feature updates</td><td>Every 6-12 months</td><td>None (security only)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support lifecycle</td><td>24 months</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Bloatware/Store apps</td><td>Included</td><td>Removed</td></tr>\n<tr><td>WPX Manager Support</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Update control</td><td>Limited</td><td>Complete control</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-configured</td><td>No</td><td>Yes, optimized for WATCHOUT</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Why choose WATCHPAX over a custom-built PC?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No surprise updates</strong> – The LTSC operating system receives security patches only; no feature updates that could change system behavior or require reboots during shows</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal background processes</strong> – No Cortana, Xbox Game Bar, or Store apps consuming resources</li>\n<li><strong>Predictable environment</strong> – The OS stays exactly as configured for years</li>\n<li><strong>Extended support</strong> – Security patches available for 5+ years without major OS upgrades</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-configured</strong> – WATCHPAX units arrive ready for WATCHOUT with optimal settings applied</li>\n\n</ul>\n<strong>Managing updates on consumer Windows:</strong>\n\n<p>If using Windows 11 Home or Pro, plan for regular maintenance windows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule Windows updates during non-show periods</li>\n<li>Test updates in a staging environment before production systems</li>\n<li>Use the \"Pause updates\" feature in Windows Settings to defer updates during critical show periods</li>\n<li>Maintain no more than 24 months behind current Windows versions to remain in Microsoft's support window</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Display computers should be dedicated to WATCHOUT playback. Avoid running other applications during live shows to ensure consistent performance.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Windows Updates and Rendering Performance</h3>\n\n<p>Keeping Windows up to date is <strong>critical for optimal WATCHOUT performance</strong>. Newer Windows updates deliver significant improvements to rendering stability and visual output quality:</p>\n\n<h4>DirectX 12 Ultimate Enhancements</h4>\n\n<p>Windows updates continuously improve DirectX 12 capabilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced memory management</strong> – Better VRAM allocation reduces out-of-memory errors with large textures and high-resolution video</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Improved shader compilation</strong> – Faster loading times and reduced hitching during playback</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Multi-adapter support</strong> – Better handling of systems with multiple GPUs</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Multi-Head Output Stability</h4>\n\n<p>For display servers driving multiple outputs, Windows updates are essential:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved EDID handling</strong> – Better detection and configuration of connected displays, especially when using EDID emulators or matrix switches</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Hotplug stability</strong> – Reduced crashes and display resets when cables are connected or disconnected</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Resolution persistence</strong> – Display configurations survive reboots more reliably</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Mosaic/Surround mode fixes</strong> – Critical patches for multi-display spanning configurations</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Security and Reliability</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kernel improvements</strong> – Reduced system crashes and blue screens during extended operation</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Memory leak fixes</strong> – Essential for 24/7 installations where systems run for weeks without restart</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Timer resolution updates</strong> – More accurate timing for frame-perfect synchronization</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always use the latest stable Windows version and cumulative updates. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production show computers.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>NVIDIA RTX PRO Professional Graphics</h3>\n\n<p>While consumer GeForce cards can run WATCHOUT, <strong>NVIDIA RTX PRO (Quadro and RTX Ada) professional GPUs</strong> are strongly recommended for display computers in production environments. Here's why:</p>\n\n<h4>Key Benefits of NVIDIA RTX PRO</h4>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Feature</th><th>NVIDIA RTX PRO</th><th>GeForce RTX</th></tr>\n<tr><td>TCC Mode</td><td>✓ Compute-optimized mode</td><td>✗ Windows display only</td></tr>\n<tr><td>EDID Management</td><td>✓ Controllable via WATCHOUT</td><td>✗ Not supported</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sync Connector</td><td>✓ Hardware genlock/framelock</td><td>✗ Software sync only</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Driver Certification</td><td>✓ Extended testing cycles</td><td>Game-focused optimization</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Support</td><td>✓ Enterprise driver branches</td><td>Consumer update cycle</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>EDID Management</h4>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT can manage EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) directly when using <strong>NVIDIA RTX PRO or Quadro</strong> graphics cards. This allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set custom resolutions and refresh rates per output</li>\n<li>Emulate display EDIDs for consistent behavior without physical displays connected</li>\n<li>Configure outputs before connecting actual projectors or screens</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> EDID management through WATCHOUT is only supported on NVIDIA professional GPUs. Users with AMD or other graphics cards will need to manage EDID settings outside of WATCHOUT using third-party tools or hardware EDID emulators.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>NVIDIA Sync Board: Framelock and Genlock</h4>\n\n<p>For multi-projector installations requiring <strong>perfect frame synchronization</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NVIDIA RTX PRO Sync boards</strong> enable hardware-level genlock between multiple GPUs and external sync sources</li>\n<li><strong>Framelock</strong> ensures all outputs across multiple cards/systems swap buffers simultaneously</li>\n<li>Critical for edge-blended panoramas and LED wall installations where frame tearing between panels is visible</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Hardware Required:</strong> Framelocking multiple display computers or syncing to an external genlock signal requires an NVIDIA Sync board installed in each display computer. This is a separate hardware add-on for RTX PRO / Quadro cards—it is not possible with consumer GeForce GPUs.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>Professional Driver Certification</h4>\n\n<p>RTX PRO drivers undergo extensive testing and certification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimal Drivers for Enterprise (ODE)</strong> – Stability-focused drivers with extended testing cycles</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Longer support lifecycle</strong> – Enterprise customers receive driver updates for extended periods</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Better regression testing</strong> – Less risk of updates breaking existing functionality</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Video Capture Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>When using video capture devices with WATCHOUT, ensure your hardware meets these requirements:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Windows Media Foundation</strong></td><td>Capture device must have Windows Media Foundation (WMF) compatible drivers</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Deltacast Cards</strong></td><td>Require GPUDirect support for optimal performance</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>GPUDirect:</strong> For Deltacast capture cards, GPUDirect enables direct memory transfer between the capture card and GPU, bypassing system memory for lower latency and reduced CPU overhead.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Storage Recommendations</h3>\n\n<p>Video playback performance depends heavily on storage speed. <strong>Sustained read rates</strong> are more important than peak specifications—this is the read speed your SSD can maintain continuously during 24/7 operation without thermal throttling.</p>\n\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Sustained vs. Peak Performance:</strong> SSD manufacturers often advertise peak read speeds, but thermal throttling can reduce actual performance during continuous operation. Ensure your system has adequate cooling for the SSD, and look for drives with good sustained performance ratings. The read rate an SSD can maintain indefinitely may be significantly lower than its maximum specification, depending on the drive model and thermal conditions.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>Video Codec Storage Requirements</h4>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Content Type</th><th>Sustained Read Required</th><th>Recommended Storage</th></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 1080p60</td><td>~59 MiB/s</td><td>SATA SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 4K60</td><td>~237 MiB/s</td><td>SATA SSD or NVMe</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Notch LC 4K60</td><td>~380 MiB/s</td><td>SATA SSD or NVMe</td></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 8K60</td><td>~949 MiB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen3 SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4K image sequence (60 fps)</td><td>~1,899 MiB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen4 SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8K image sequence (60 fps)</td><td>~7,594 MiB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen4 RAID array</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Asset Disk Space Guidelines</h4>\n\n<p>Plan storage capacity based on your content library. Below are typical file sizes for common media formats:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Content</th><th>Duration/Count</th><th>Approximate Size</th></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 1080p60 video</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~3.5 GiB</td></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 4K60 video</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~14 GiB</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Notch LC 4K60 video</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~22 GiB</td></tr>\n<tr><td>HAP 8K60 video</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~56 GiB</td></tr>\n<tr><td>4K image sequence (60 fps)</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~111 GiB</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8K image sequence (60 fps)</td><td>1 minute</td><td>~446 GiB</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Images are stored as RAW/uncompressed for optimal playback performance. ProRes and other compressed video formats are automatically optimized to Notch LC by default.\n</p></div>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For shows with large media libraries, calculate total storage needs including headroom for revisions and additional content. A 1 TB NVMe SSD is suitable for most productions; consider 2 TB or more for 4K/8K heavy projects.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Network Requirements</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Speed</td><td>1 Gbps</td><td>2.5 Gbps</td></tr>\n</table>\n| Switch | Managed Gigabit switch | Enterprise-grade with IGMP snooping |ßß\n<table>\n<tr><th>Topology</th><th>Star (all on same subnet)</th><th>Dedicated VLAN for WATCHOUT</th></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Why 2.5 Gbps?</strong> Most modern motherboards include 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet as standard, providing a significant improvement over 1 Gbps without the cost and complexity of 10 Gbps infrastructure. This is the same networking standard used in WATCHPAX display servers.\n</p></div>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>What is IGMP Snooping?</strong> Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping is a switch feature that optimizes multicast traffic. Without it, multicast packets (used by WATCHOUT for synchronization and NDI video) flood all switch ports, wasting bandwidth. With IGMP snooping enabled, the switch intelligently forwards multicast traffic only to devices that need it—reducing network congestion and improving overall performance, especially in systems with multiple display servers or NDI sources.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>NDI Stream Bandwidth Requirements</h4>\n\n<p>NDI (Network Device Interface) is commonly used for video input in WATCHOUT. Here are the typical bandwidth requirements:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Resolution</th><th>Frame Rate</th><th>Bandwidth (approx.)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1920×1080</td><td>60 fps</td><td>~125 Mbps</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3840×2160 (4K)</td><td>60 fps</td><td>~250 Mbps</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7680×4320 (8K)</td><td>60 fps</td><td>~500 Mbps</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Multiple simultaneous NDI streams may require 2.5 Gbps or faster networking depending on total throughput.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>File Transfer Time Comparison</h4>\n\n<p>Network speed dramatically affects how quickly you can deploy media to display servers. The table below shows approximate transfer times for common file sizes:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>File Size</th><th>1 Gbps (~119 MiB/s)</th><th>2.5 Gbps (~298 MiB/s)</th><th>10 Gbps (~1.2 GiB/s)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1 GiB</td><td>~9 seconds</td><td>~4 seconds</td><td>~1 second</td></tr>\n<tr><td>100 GiB</td><td>~15 minutes</td><td>~6 minutes</td><td>~90 seconds</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1 TiB</td><td>~2.5 hours</td><td>~60 minutes</td><td>~15 minutes</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Actual transfer speeds depend on disk I/O, network congestion, and switch quality. The values above assume modern SSDs and a well-configured network with minimal overhead.\n</p></div>\n\n<p>For productions with large media libraries or frequent content updates, faster networking pays for itself quickly in reduced setup and rehearsal time. Consider higher-speed networking especially for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4K/8K video content</strong> – Single uncompressed 4K frames can exceed 30 MB</li>\n<li><strong>Image sequences</strong> – Thousands of files that benefit from sustained throughput</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-server deployments</strong> – Simultaneous transfers to multiple display computers</li>\n<li><strong>Live event environments</strong> – Last-minute content changes require rapid deployment</li>\n\n</ul>",

The system relies on the network not just for file transfer, but for frame-accurate synchronization (UDP) and system control (TCP).</p>\n\n<h3>General Recommendations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Network:</strong> The WATCHOUT network should be a closed, dedicated local area network (LAN). Do <strong>not</strong> connect it to the internet or a general office network alongside your show data.</li>\n<li><strong>Wired Connections:</strong> Always use wired Ethernet connections (Cat5e, Cat6, or fiber). Wi-Fi is not supported for show synchronization due to latency and packet loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Components:</strong> Invest in reliable, professional-grade networking equipment. Consumer-grade hardware may introduce latency spikes or dropped packets under sustained load.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommended Network Hardware</h3>\n\n<p>Choosing the right hardware ensures stable, low-latency communication between your Production and Display computers.</p>\n\n<h4>Network Switches</h4>\n\n<p>For most WATCHOUT installations, a quality unmanaged gigabit switch is sufficient. However, for larger or more demanding setups, consider managed switches that offer greater control.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Type</th><th>Use Case</th><th>Recommended Models</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Unmanaged Gigabit</strong></td><td>Small to medium shows<br>(2-8 displays)</td><td>Netgear GS108, TP-Link TL-SG108,<br>Cisco CBS110</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Managed Gigabit</strong></td><td>Medium to large shows,<br>VLANs, QoS</td><td>Cisco CBS250, Netgear GS310TP,<br>Ubiquiti UniFi Switch</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>10GbE</strong></td><td>High bandwidth<br>(NDI, 4K+, many outputs)</td><td>Netgear XS508M, MikroTik CRS305,<br>Ubiquiti UniFi 10G</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Disable Power Saving Features:</strong> If using managed switches, disable \"Green Ethernet,\" \"Energy Efficient Ethernet\" (EEE), and any auto-sleep modes. These features can interrupt synchronization and cause stuttering.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>Network Interface Cards (NICs)</h4>\n\n<p>Built-in motherboard NICs (Intel I211, I225, Realtek RTL8125) are typically adequate. For demanding workflows (10GbE, NDI sources), consider dedicated add-in cards:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intel X550-T2:</strong> Dual-port 10GbE, excellent driver support.</li>\n<li><strong>Mellanox ConnectX-3:</strong> High performance, often used in broadcast environments.</li>\n<li><strong>ASUS XG-C100C:</strong> Cost-effective 10GbE option for smaller budgets.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Cabling</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cat5e:</strong> Suitable for Gigabit Ethernet up to 100 meters.</li>\n<li><strong>Cat6/Cat6a:</strong> Recommended for 10GbE or runs approaching 100 meters with better shielding.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiber Optic (SFP/SFP+):</strong> Essential for long-distance runs (over 100 meters) or electrically noisy environments (near LED walls, dimmers, etc.).</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>IP Addressing</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT computers must be on the same subnet to discover each other. We recommend using static IP addresses to ensure consistent connectivity.</p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Scheme</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subnet Mask:</strong> <code>255.255.255.0</code> (Class C)</li>\n<li><strong>Production Computer:</strong> <code>192.168.1.10</code></li>\n<li><strong>Display Computers:</strong> <code>192.168.1.11</code>, <code>192.168.1.12</code>, etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Avoid DHCP:</strong> While WATCHOUT can technically work with auto-assigned IPs (DHCP), it is strongly discouraged for live environments. IPs can change upon reboot, potentially breaking your mapping and control links.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Windows Firewall</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 requires specific network ports to operate. Upon installation, the installer typically adds the necessary rules to the Windows Defender Firewall.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to manage ports manually:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TCP Port 3040:</strong> Main communication.</li>\n<li><strong>UDP Port 3040:</strong> Synchronization.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> Various ports are used for the new Asset Manager syncing; ensure the <code>Dataton.Watchout.exe</code> and <code>Dataton.Watchout.Display.exe</code> applications are fully allowed through the firewall for both Private and Public profile types.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Advanced: Jumbo Frames</h3>\n\n<p>For 10GbE networks or systems pushing very high bandwidth video data (especially NDI or uncompressed streams), enabling <strong>Jumbo Frames</strong> (usually 9000 MTU) on all network cards and switches can improve performance. Ensure every device in the chain supports and is configured for the same MTU size.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Testing Tip:</strong> After changing MTU settings, use <code>ping -f -l 8972 <target_ip></code> from a command prompt to verify jumbo frames are working end-to-end. If the ping fails, a device in the chain isn't configured correctly.\n</p></div>",

The application uses a windowed design where each component operates in its own resizable, repositionable window, allowing you to customize your workspace to match your project requirements and personal preferences.</p>\n\n<h3>Window Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 employs a <strong>multi-document interface</strong> where all primary functions exist as separate windows within the main application frame:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage</strong> – Your visual canvas showing all displays and content positioning</li>\n<li><strong>Timeline</strong> – Where you arrange and time cues for your show</li>\n<li><strong>Assets</strong> – Your media library for managing project files</li>\n<li><strong>Properties</strong> – Context-sensitive settings for selected items</li>\n<li><strong>Network</strong> – Device discovery and connection management</li>\n\n</ul>\nEach window can be:\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Moved</strong> – Drag the title bar to reposition</li>\n<li><strong>Resized</strong> – Drag corners or edges to adjust dimensions</li>\n<li><strong>Closed</strong> – Click the × button in the title bar</li>\n<li><strong>Docked</strong> – Hold <code>Ctrl</code> and double-click the title bar to dock to an edge</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Menu Bar</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Menu Bar</strong> provides access to all application commands organized in logical groups:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Menu</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>File</strong></td><td>Create, open, save, and export shows</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Edit</strong></td><td>Undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, and selection commands</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Stage</strong></td><td>Display and projector management, view controls</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Media</strong></td><td>Add and manage media files</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Timeline</strong></td><td>Layer, cue, and playback controls</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Tween</strong></td><td>Animation property toggles</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Window</strong></td><td>Workspace layout and window visibility</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Help</strong></td><td>Documentation, licenses, and about information</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Keyboard Accelerators</h3>\n\n<p>Most menu commands have associated keyboard shortcuts displayed alongside the command name. Common accelerators follow standard conventions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Ctrl+N</code> – New show</li>\n<li><code>Ctrl+O</code> – Open show</li>\n<li><code>Ctrl+S</code> – Save show</li>\n<li><code>Ctrl+Z</code> – Undo</li>\n<li><code>Ctrl+Shift+Z</code> – Redo</li>\n<li><code>Spacebar</code> – Toggle playback</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Theme Support</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 supports both <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>light</strong> visual themes. Toggle between themes via <strong>Window → Light Theme</strong> or through preferences. The dark theme reduces eye strain in low-light production environments, while the light theme may be preferred in brighter working conditions.</p>\n\n<h3>Director Connection Status</h3>\n\n<p>The interface displays real-time connection status to the <strong>Director</strong> service. When connected, windows requiring Director communication (such as Timeline and Assets) show full functionality. When disconnected, these windows display an offline indicator with the message \"Director offline\" and a cloud-off icon.</p>\n\n<h3>Window Focus</h3>\n\n<p>The currently active window displays with enhanced visual prominence—a brighter border and stronger shadow in dark mode. Only the focused window receives keyboard input, and clicking any window brings it to the front and transfers focus.</p>",

      "Creating a New Show": "<div class=\"article-metadata\"><span class=\"article-status status-draft\">Status: draft</span><span class=\"article-author-badge\">Author: Karol</span><span class=\"article-editor-badge\">Editor: Jacquie</span><span class=\"article-qc-badge\">Quality Check: JME</span><span class=\"article-date-badge\">Last Edit: 2026-02-09</span><a href=\"[[RELATIVE_PATH]]content/03-working-with-shows/01-creating-a-new-show.md\" class=\"article-source-badge\" download>Source MD</a></div><h2>Creating a New Show</h2>\n\n<p>Every WATCHOUT project begins with creating a show. A show is the container for all your displays, timelines, cues, and media references—essentially your entire production wrapped into a single document that can be saved, shared, and deployed across your network.</p>\n\n<p>When you create a new show, WATCHOUT prepares a fresh workspace with an empty Stage canvas and at least one Timeline ready for programming. No displays are defined yet, no media has been imported, and the stage coordinates default to a neutral origin point. This blank slate approach means you have complete control over how your production takes shape from the very beginning.</p>\n\n<h3>Starting a New Show</h3>\n\n<p>You can create a new show in two ways. From the <strong>Welcome Screen</strong> that appears when you first launch Producer, click <strong>New Show</strong> to begin immediately. Alternatively, if you're already working in the application, choose <strong>File → New</strong> from the menu bar.</p>\n\n<p>If you have unsaved changes in a currently open show, WATCHOUT will ask whether you want to save your work before proceeding. This safeguard ensures you never accidentally lose edits by starting fresh.</p>\n\n<h3>What a New Show Contains</h3>\n\n<p>A freshly created show includes the fundamental structures you need to begin production work. The <strong>Stage</strong> window displays an empty canvas where you'll eventually position displays and arrange visual content. A default <strong>Timeline</strong> is created so you can start adding cues right away. The show also inherits default settings for frame rate, timing resolution, and network routing that you can adjust later through Show Properties.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, nothing is connected—no display servers, no Director, no Asset Manager. The show exists purely as a local document on your Producer workstation until you choose to connect it to network resources.</p>\n\n<h3>Organizing Your Project Files</h3>\n\n<p>Consider where you'll store your show file before you begin programming. Keeping your show file alongside its associated media assets in a dedicated project folder simplifies collaboration and makes packaging the show for transport much easier. A typical structure might place the show file in a project root folder with subfolders for video assets, images, and audio.</p>\n\n<p>When multiple team members work on the same production, consistent folder conventions prevent confusion about which version of the show is current and where media files should be located.</p>\n\n<h3>Network Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>If you create a show while already connected to network nodes, WATCHOUT remains aware of the Director's state. Should you attempt to deploy your new show to a Director that's already running a different production, you'll receive a warning about overriding the existing show. This protection helps prevent accidental interruptions to live systems.</p>",
      "Opening Existing Shows": "<div class=\"article-metadata\"><span class=\"article-status status-draft\">Status: draft</span><span class=\"article-author-badge\">Author: Karol</span><span class=\"article-editor-badge\">Editor: Jacquie</span><span class=\"article-qc-badge\">Quality Check: JME</span><span class=\"article-date-badge\">Last Edit: 2026-02-09</span><a href=\"[[RELATIVE_PATH]]content/03-working-with-shows/02-opening-existing-shows.md\" class=\"article-source-badge\" download>Source MD</a></div><h2>Opening Existing Shows</h2>\n\n<p>Most of your time in WATCHOUT will be spent working on shows that already exist—whether you created them yourself in an earlier session or received them from a colleague. The application provides several ways to return to previous work, each suited to different situations.</p>\n\n<h3>Opening from Disk</h3>\n\n<p>The most common method is opening a show file directly from your computer's storage. Choose <strong>File → Open</strong> or press <code>Ctrl+O</code> to browse for a show file. WATCHOUT's file dialog filters for its native show format, making it easy to locate the correct file among other project assets.</p>\n\n<p>For shows you've worked on recently, <strong>File → Open Recent</strong> provides quick access without navigating through folders. Producer remembers your recent show history, so returning to yesterday's work typically requires just two clicks.</p>\n\n<h3>Opening from a Director</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the show you want to work on isn't stored locally—it's already running on a Director node elsewhere on the network. In these situations, use <strong>File → Open Show from Director</strong> to connect directly to the running production.</p>\n\n<p>This approach proves valuable when you need to take over programming responsibilities on an existing system. Rather than transferring files and risking version mismatches, you connect straight to the live show data. The same method works well when verifying show state before a performance or when handing off between operators during a multi-day event.</p>\n\n<p>The Welcome Screen also offers connection options for Director-hosted shows, letting you choose between starting fresh locally or joining an existing network session.</p>\n\n<h3>Protecting Unsaved Work</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT guards against accidental data loss when switching between shows. If your current show contains unsaved changes and you attempt to open a different one, the application pauses to ask what you'd like to do. You can save your current work, proceed without saving (abandoning recent edits), or cancel the operation entirely and remain in your current show.</p>\n\n<p>This protection applies regardless of how you're opening the new show—whether from disk, from a Director, or via the recent files list.</p>\n\n<h3>Director Override Warnings</h3>\n\n<p>When opening a show from a Director that's already running a different production, WATCHOUT displays a prominent warning. Proceeding with the operation will replace the currently running show with the one you're opening, which could interrupt playback or affect displays that are actively showing content.</p>\n\n<p>In rehearsal environments this is typically acceptable, but during live performances such an override could be disruptive. The warning ensures you always make this choice deliberately rather than accidentally.</p>",
      "Saving Your Work": "<div class=\"article-metadata\"><span class=\"article-status status-draft\">Status: draft</span><span class=\"article-author-badge\">Author: Karol</span><span class=\"article-editor-badge\">Editor: Jacquie</span><span class=\"article-qc-badge\">Quality Check: JME</span><span class=\"article-date-badge\">Last Edit: 2026-02-09</span><a href=\"[[RELATIVE_PATH]]content/03-working-with-shows/03-saving-your-work.md\" class=\"article-source-badge\" download>Source MD</a></div><h2>Saving Your Work</h2>\n\n<p>Regular saving is fundamental to any production workflow. WATCHOUT provides several save options to accommodate different scenarios—from quick incremental saves during programming to deliberate version snapshots before major changes.</p>\n\n<h3>The Save Command</h3>\n\n<p>The primary save command, accessible via <strong>File → Save</strong> or <code>Ctrl+S</code>, writes your current changes to the show file you're working in. If you're editing a show that's never been saved, this command prompts you to choose a location and filename.</p>\n\n<p>Use this frequently throughout your programming session. Timeline edits, display configurations, property adjustments—all of these modifications live only in memory until you save. A power interruption or application crash would lose unsaved work, so developing a habit of regular saves protects your progress.</p>\n\n<h3>Save As</h3>\n\n<p><strong>File → Save As</strong> (or <code>Ctrl+Shift+S</code>) lets you write the current show to a new file with a different name or location. After saving, your working context switches to this new file—subsequent saves will update the new location rather than the original.</p>\n\n<p>This command is useful when you want to branch your work. Perhaps you're about to make experimental changes and want to preserve a known-good version first. By saving as a new file, you create a checkpoint you can return to if the experiment doesn't work out.</p>\n\n<h3>Save Copy</h3>\n\n<p><strong>File → Save Copy</strong> creates a duplicate of your show without changing which file you're actively working in. The copy is written to a location you specify, but your current show file remains the active target for future saves.</p>\n\n<p>Think of this as creating a snapshot for archival purposes. You might save a copy before a major rehearsal to preserve that day's version, then continue editing without interruption. The copy serves as a recoverable milestone while your workflow continues unbroken.</p>\n\n<h3>Understanding the Differences</h3>\n\n<p>The distinction between these three commands matters in practice. <strong>Save</strong> updates your current file. <strong>Save As</strong> creates a new file and switches your context to it. <strong>Save Copy</strong> creates a new file but leaves your context unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing which to use prevents confusion about which file contains your latest work. When collaborating with others or managing multiple versions of a production, clear understanding of your save behavior keeps everyone synchronized.</p>",
      "Show Properties": "<div class=\"article-metadata\"><span class=\"article-status status-draft\">Status: draft</span><span class=\"article-author-badge\">Author: Karol</span><span class=\"article-editor-badge\">Editor: Jacquie</span><span class=\"article-qc-badge\">Quality Check: JME</span><span class=\"article-date-badge\">Last Edit: 2026-02-09</span><a href=\"[[RELATIVE_PATH]]content/03-working-with-shows/04-show-properties.md\" class=\"article-source-badge\" download>Source MD</a></div><h2>Show Properties</h2>\n\n<p>Every show carries a set of properties that define how it behaves globally—settings that affect all timelines, all displays, and all network interactions. These properties establish the fundamental parameters under which your entire production operates.</p>\n\n<h3>Accessing Show Properties</h3>\n\n<p>Show properties are accessible through the <strong>Properties</strong> panel when no specific element is selected. Alternatively, you can access them via the <strong>Show > Show Properties</strong> menu option. The properties panel displays all configurable settings organized into logical sections.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>General Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>Frame Rate</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Frame Rate</strong> determines the temporal resolution for all timeline operations throughout your show. This setting affects how precisely you can position cues in time and how smoothly animations play back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Available Presets:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>23.98 FPS</strong> – Standard film rate (24000/1001)</li> <li><strong>24 FPS</strong> – Film rate</li> <li><strong>25 FPS</strong> – PAL/SECAM broadcast standard</li> <li><strong>29.97 FPS</strong> – NTSC broadcast standard (30000/1001)</li> <li><strong>30 FPS</strong> – Standard video rate</li> <li><strong>48 FPS</strong> – High frame rate film</li> <li><strong>50 FPS</strong> – PAL high frame rate</li> <li><strong>59.94 FPS</strong> – NTSC high frame rate (60000/1001)</li> <li><strong>60 FPS</strong> – High frame rate video</li> <li><strong>120 FPS</strong> – Ultra high frame rate</li> <li><strong>Custom</strong> – Specify any frame rate using numerator and denominator values</li></p>\n\n</ul>\nWhen selecting <strong>Custom</strong>, you can specify the exact numerator and denominator. The denominator options are <strong>1</strong> (for integer frame rates) or <strong>1.001</strong> (for NTSC-compatible fractional rates).\n\n<p>> <strong>Note:</strong> Frame rate changes affect how timeline positions are calculated. Changing this setting mid-production may shift the timing of existing cues.</p>\n\n<h3>Eye Point</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Eye Point</strong> defines the default viewer position in 3D space, used for perspective calculations across displays. This setting consists of three coordinates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>X</strong> – Horizontal position of the viewer</li>\n<li><strong>Y</strong> – Vertical position (height) of the viewer  </li>\n<li><strong>Z</strong> – Distance from the stage/display plane</li>\n\n</ul>\nThe eye point is particularly important for:\n<ul>\n<li>3D projection mapping scenarios</li>\n<li>Multi-display perspective corrections</li>\n<li>Virtual camera positioning</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Auto Update Assets</h3>\n\n<p>When enabled, the <strong>Auto Update Assets</strong> option automatically refreshes media files when changes are detected on the Asset Manager. This is useful during content development when source files are being actively modified.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>State</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Enabled</strong></td><td>WATCHOUT monitors source files and updates cues when files change</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Disabled</strong></td><td>Assets remain static until manually refreshed</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>> <strong>Caution:</strong> Enable this setting during content development, but consider disabling it for live shows to prevent unexpected visual changes.</p>\n\n<h3>SDI Genlock</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>SDI Genlock</strong> option enables hardware synchronization for outputs using SDI (Serial Digital Interface) connections. When enabled, WATCHOUT locks video output timing to an external reference signal.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>State</th><th>Use Case</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Enabled</strong></td><td>Synchronized multi-display setups with SDI infrastructure</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Disabled</strong></td><td>Standard software-timed output</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>Genlock ensures frame-accurate synchronization across multiple displays, eliminating tearing or timing drift. This requires compatible SDI hardware with genlock input capability.</p>\n\n<h3>Default Anchor Position</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Default Anchor Position</strong> determines the reference point for newly created media cues. When you add a media cue to a timeline, this anchor point defines which part of the media aligns with the specified position.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Available Options:</strong></p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Top Left</strong></td><td>Upper-left corner as reference</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Top</strong></td><td>Center of top edge</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Top Right</strong></td><td>Upper-right corner</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Left</strong></td><td>Center of left edge</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Center</strong></td><td>Center of the media (default)</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Right</strong></td><td>Center of right edge</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Bottom Left</strong></td><td>Lower-left corner</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Bottom</strong></td><td>Center of bottom edge</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Bottom Right</strong></td><td>Lower-right corner</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>The anchor position is represented visually using a 3×3 grid selector in the Properties panel.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Sync Groups</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Sync Groups</strong> coordinate playback timing across multiple display servers. By grouping nodes together, you ensure their timelines run in lockstep, which is essential for seamless multi-display presentations.</p>\n\n<h3>Managing Sync Groups</h3>\n\n<p>To create a new sync group: <ol> <li>Click <strong>Add Sync Group</strong></li> <li>Enter a name for the group</li> <li>Add member nodes by typing or selecting from available devices</li></p>\n\n</ol>\nEach sync group displays its member nodes, which can be added or removed using the multi-select chip interface. Nodes are identified by their host reference names as they appear on the network.\n\n<h3>When to Use Sync Groups</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-server installations</strong> – When content spans multiple playback machines</li>\n<li><strong>Edge-blended displays</strong> – Where precise frame alignment prevents visible seams</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant systems</strong> – To keep backup servers synchronized with primary units</li>\n\n</ul>\n> <strong>Note:</strong> Nodes must be network-accessible to participate in sync group coordination. Verify network connectivity before adding nodes to sync groups.\n\n---\n\n<h2>Host Configuration</h2>\n\n<p>Host settings define the network infrastructure supporting your show. These properties are typically configured during initial setup and bind the show to specific servers.</p>\n\n<h3>Director</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Director</strong> host coordinates overall show playback. This is the central server that: <ul> <li>Manages timeline execution</li> <li>Coordinates commands across all nodes</li> <li>Maintains master timing for the production</li></p>\n\n</ul>\nThe Director hostname appears in the menu bar during active connections.\n\n<h3>Asset Manager</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Asset Manager</strong> host stores and distributes media files to display nodes. This server: <ul> <li>Maintains the central asset library</li> <li>Handles file distribution to playback nodes</li> <li>Manages asset versioning and updates</li></p>\n\n</ul>\nThe Asset Manager connection status enables or disables asset-related operations throughout the application.\n\n<h3>Time Server</h3>\n\n<p>The optional <strong>Time Server</strong> provides network time synchronization for the show. This ensures all nodes reference the same clock source for coordinated playback.</p>\n\n<h3>Log Server</h3>\n\n<p>The optional <strong>Log Server</strong> receives logging output from all nodes in the production. Centralizing logs simplifies troubleshooting and provides a unified view of system activity.</p>\n\n---\n\n<h2>Best Practices</h2>\n\n<h3>During Pre-Production</h3>\n\n<p>Establish your show properties early in the production process: <ul> <li>Set the frame rate to match your content and output requirements</li> <li>Configure host addresses for your network environment</li> <li>Define sync groups based on your display topology</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>During Technical Rehearsals</h3>\n\n<p>Technical rehearsals often reveal issues related to show properties: <ul> <li>Verify sync group membership matches physical node connections</li> <li>Confirm frame rate compatibility with content and displays</li> <li>Test genlock settings if using synchronized SDI outputs</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>During Live Shows</h3>\n\n<p>Maintain stability during live operation: <ul> <li>Avoid changing frame rate or host configuration</li> <li>Consider disabling auto-update assets to prevent surprises</li> <li>Document your property settings for quick recovery if needed</li></p>\n\n</ul>\nIf a property change becomes necessary during a live show, pause playback to a safe state before making adjustments. The brief transition is preferable to unexpected disruptions during active content playback."
