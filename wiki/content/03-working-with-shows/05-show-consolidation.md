## Show Consolidation

<!-- STUB: This article should explain the show consolidation feature, which packages a show file together with all referenced assets into a single portable unit. -->

### Content to include

- **What consolidation does** — explain that consolidation copies all referenced assets into a self-contained show package, making the show portable between systems without relying on an external Asset Manager.
- **When to consolidate** — use cases such as archiving a finished show, transferring a show to a different site, or creating a backup snapshot before major edits.
- **Consolidate Show** — step-by-step procedure via File menu, what happens during the process, and expected output.
- **Unconsolidate Show** — how to reverse consolidation, restoring the show to reference assets from the Asset Manager rather than embedded copies.
- **Limitations and considerations** — file size implications, behavior with dynamic assets, and how consolidation interacts with multi-node setups.
