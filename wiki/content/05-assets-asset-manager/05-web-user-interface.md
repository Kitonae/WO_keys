## Web User Interface

WATCHOUT 7 includes a web-based interface for managing assets remotely. This allows team members to upload and organize media without direct access to the production computer.

### Accessing the Web UI

- Open a web browser on any device on the same network

- Navigate to `http://[producer-ip]:3040`

- The Asset Manager web interface loads automatically

### Features

- **Upload Files** – Drag and drop or browse to upload media

- **Browse Assets** – View all assets in the current show

- **Create Folders** – Organize assets into folders

- **Preview Media** – View thumbnails and preview video

- **Check Status** – Monitor optimization progress

- **Delete Assets** – Remove unwanted media

### Upload Progress

Large files show upload progress in the web interface. Once uploaded, optimization begins automatically.

### Security Considerations

- The web UI is accessible to anyone on the local network

- Consider network segmentation for production environments

- Use firewall rules to restrict access if needed

### Mobile Access

The web interface is responsive and works on tablets and smartphones for on-the-go asset management.
