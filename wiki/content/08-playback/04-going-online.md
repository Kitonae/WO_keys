## Going Online

Operationally, going online means your show is actively controlled through a Director with reachable Runner and Asset Manager services.

### Online Readiness Checklist

- Producer is connected to the correct **Director**
- Required nodes are discovered and healthy
- Asset Manager is reachable
- Displays are routed to expected hosts/channels
- Show state is saved

### First Online Pass

Use a short verification pass:

1. Run a known test timeline.
2. Confirm visual outputs on all critical displays.
3. Confirm audio/device-trigger behavior.
4. Check for warnings in activity/log views.

### Common Online Risks

- Director/Runner mismatch (different loaded shows)
- Stale node aliases or duplicate names
- Asset transfer not complete before playback

:::warning
Never assume online readiness from a single green indicator. Verify end-to-end output behavior.
