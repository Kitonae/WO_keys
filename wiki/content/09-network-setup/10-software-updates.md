## Software Updates

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the remote software update mechanism for pushing WATCHOUT updates to nodes from Producer. -->

### Content to include

- **Update mechanism** — explain that Producer can push its own software version to remote nodes, ensuring all nodes in the production run the same version.
- **Initiating an update** — how to select target nodes and trigger the update from node properties or the network window. The confirmation dialog and warnings about node restart.
- **Update process** — what happens during the update: file transfer, installation, automatic restart, and manual steps that may be required to start WATCHOUT Manager afterward.
- **Version mismatch warnings** — the visual indicator on nodes running a different version than Producer, and why version alignment matters for protocol compatibility.
- **Switching to WATCHOUT 6** — the option to switch a node back to WATCHOUT 6 operation, triggering a machine restart.
- **Best practices** — update during controlled downtime, verify all nodes report the same version after update, and keep a backup of the previous version's installer.
