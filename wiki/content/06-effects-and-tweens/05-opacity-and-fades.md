## Opacity and Fades

Opacity and fade controls define visibility transitions for cues.

### Opacity Tween

Use **Opacity** tween (`Alt+O`) for fully custom transparency animation.

### Fade Helpers

WATCHOUT also supports dedicated fade actions:

- **Fade In** (`Shift+Alt+I`)
- **Fade Out** (`Shift+Alt+O`)
- **Cross Fade** (`Shift+Alt+X`)

These provide fast transition setup with reusable defaults.

### When to Use Which

- Use **fade helpers** for quick standard transitions.
- Use **opacity tween curves** for precise non-linear behavior.

### Common Mistakes

- Overlapping fades without checking final blend result.
- Fades that start/end before cue visibility windows.
