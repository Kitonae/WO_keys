## Audio Volume

Volume tweens automate cue loudness over time.

### Add Volume Automation

Use **Volume** tween actions or shortcut `Alt+V` on cues with audio content.

### Common Scenarios

- Music fade-ins and fade-outs
- Ducking under voice-over or announcements
- Layered ambience balancing

### Practical Workflow

1. Set initial cue gain.
2. Add volume tween points at scene boundaries.
3. Verify transitions on the target audio routing path.

### Notes for Complex Shows

If you use multiple output buses/channels, validate both cue-level volume and device/channel mapping so automation behaves as expected at the final output.
