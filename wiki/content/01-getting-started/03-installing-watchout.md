## Installing WATCHOUT

Setting up WATCHOUT represents the first step toward creating your show. The installation process is straightforward, but ensuring your system is prepared correctly is key to a stable performance environment.

### Getting the Installer

1.  Visit the official Dataton website at **dataton.com/downloads**.
2.  Navigate to the **WATCHOUT 7** section.
3.  Download the latest release installer.

### Installation Process

#### 1. Run as Administrator
Right-click the downloaded installer file and select **Run as administrator**. This ensures the installer has the necessary permissions to register components and modify system settings.

#### 2. Select Components
During installation, you will be prompted to select components. Ensure valid options are selected for your needs.

#### 3. Drivers and Prerequisites
The installer checks for and installs several critical system dependencies. It is essential to allow these installations to complete:

*   **CodeMeter Runtime:** This is the background service that manages your Dataton license keys. It ensures your software is properly authorized and handles network licensing if applicable.
*   **Microsoft WebView2:** Required for certain parts of the user interface (such as the Asset Manager and Help system) that are built on modern web technologies.
*   **Vulkan Runtime:** A modern, high-performance graphics API. WATCHOUT 7 uses Vulkan for its rendering engine to achieve lower overhead and efficient GPU resource management.

#### 4. Restart
After the installation completes, **restart your computer**. This is mandatory to ensure all system drivers and network services are correctly initialized.

### Post-Installation Checklist

*   **Windows Settings:** Set "Power & sleep" settings to **Never** for both screen and sleep.
*   **Notifications:** Turn off "Focus assist" and Windows notifications to prevent interruptions.
*   **User Account:** It is recommended to run WATCHOUT under a Standard User account with auto-login enabled for Display computers, not Administrator, to prevent accidental system changes during a show.
