## Quick Start Tutorial

Follow these steps to create your first simple presentation.

### Step 1: Create a New Show

1.  Launch WATCHOUT.
2.  Select **New Project** from the Welcome screen.
3.  Name your file (e.g., "MyFirstShow") and save it to a local folder.

### Step 2: Add and Address a Display

To output video to a real screen, you must define a display in the software and link it to a physical computer.

1.  Go to the **Stage** menu and select **Add Display**. A colored rectangle will appear on the Stage window.
2.  Double-click this display rectangle to open its **Properties**.
3.  **Name:** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Main Screen").
4.  **Address:** This is critical. Enter the **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.11`) or the **Hostname** of your target Display Computer.
    *   *Tip: Ensure the Display software is running on that computer.*
5.  **Resolution:** Set the width and height to match your physical output (e.g., `1920` x `1080`).
6.  Click **OK**.

### Step 3: Go Online

1.  Go to the **Stage** menu and click **Online** (or press `Ctrl+L`).
2.  The software will attempt to connect to the address you specified in Step 2.
3.  If successful, the Display Computer will show your stage background (usually black) instead of the logo screen.

### Step 4: Import Media

1.  Locate the **Assets** window (usually bottom-right).
2.  Open your file browser (Windows Explorer).
3.  Drag an image or video file directly from Explorer into the **Assets** window.

### Step 5: Place on Timeline

1.  Drag your media file from the **Assets** window onto the **Timeline** window.
2.  This creates a **Cue**.
3.  Drag the cue left or right to set when it should start playing.

### Step 6: Position on Stage

1.  Make sure the **Timeline Cursor** (the red playhead) is positioned over your cue so it is visible.
2.  Look at the **Stage** window. You should see your image.
3.  Click and drag the image on the Stage to position it inside your Display rectangle.

### Step 7: Run the Show

1.  Press the **Spacebar** to play.
2.  Watch your physical screen. The content you see on the Stage window will be synchronized perfectly to the Display Computer updates.
