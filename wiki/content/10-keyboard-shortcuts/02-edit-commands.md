## Edit Commands

These shortcuts are context-sensitive and operate on the active edit target.

| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo (alternate) |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete selection |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select all |
| `Ctrl+E` | Select to end |
| `Ctrl+F` | Find |
| `Ctrl+M` | Move |
| `Ctrl+N` | Toggle snapping |
| `Enter` | Open/activate properties |

### Tip

If a shortcut appears to do nothing, check which window has focus and whether the current selection context allows that operation.
