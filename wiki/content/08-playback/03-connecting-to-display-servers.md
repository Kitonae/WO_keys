## Connecting to Display Servers

### Automatic Discovery

WATCHOUT automatically discovers display servers on the same network. They appear in the Network window.

### Manual Connection

If a server doesn't appear, verify:

- Both computers are on the same network subnet

- Firewall rules are properly configured

- The display server software is running
