## Chroma Key

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the per-cue chroma key (green/blue screen) feature that removes a specified color from the rendered output. -->

### Content to include

- **What chroma key is** — a compositing technique that removes a specific color from a cue's rendered output, making those areas transparent. Commonly used with green screen or blue screen footage.
- **Enabling chroma key** — how to activate chroma keying on a cue via the cue properties panel (the Chroma Key section).
- **Presets** — the built-in presets for common key colors: Green and Blue. The Custom option for arbitrary key colors.
- **Target color** — configuring the exact target color to key out, using either RGB (Red/Green/Blue) or HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) controls.
- **Tolerance** — the Min and Max tolerance parameters that control how closely a pixel must match the target color to be keyed out. Min defines the inner boundary (fully transparent), Max defines the outer boundary (partially transparent).
- **Spill removal** — the spill removal toggle that reduces color contamination from the key color on foreground edges.
- **Visualize Mask** — the toggle to preview the alpha mask generated by the chroma key, showing keyed areas in a diagnostic view for tuning.
- **Reset** — how to reset chroma key parameters to defaults.
- **Use cases** — live camera feeds with green screen backdrops, pre-recorded keyed footage, removing uniform backgrounds from content.
- **Tips** — achieving clean keys with proper lighting, avoiding shadows on the key color, and combining with opacity tweens.
