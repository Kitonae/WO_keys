## Working with Layers

Layers determine draw order and help organize complex timelines.

### Layer Basics

- Higher layers visually stack above lower layers.
- Layer names should reflect purpose (for example `BG`, `FX`, `Titles`).
- Keep a clean layer structure early to avoid late-stage confusion.

### Layer Operations

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Insert layer | `Ctrl+I` |
| Delete active layer | `Ctrl+Delete` |
| Select all cues on active layer | *(menu action)* |

You can also append layers and reorder them during timeline editing.

### Layer-Focused Workflow

- Use one layer for each functional category when possible.
- Keep control cues separate from media-heavy layers.
- Lock or minimize edits to stable layers during live programming.

### Key-Layer Considerations

Some workflows use key/fill logic at layer level. Verify cue compatibility before grouping effects across mixed-purpose layers.
