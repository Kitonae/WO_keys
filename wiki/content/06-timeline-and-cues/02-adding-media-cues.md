## Adding Media Cues

Media cues are created by placing assets on a timeline.

### Add a Cue

1. Import media into **Assets**.
2. Drag the asset into the Timeline.
3. Drop at the desired start time and layer.

### Placement Behavior

WATCHOUT supports different placement strategies during drag/drop:

- **Sequence-oriented** placement
- **Layer-oriented** placement

Use modifier behavior (such as `Ctrl` during drag) when you want to force layer-based placement behavior.

### Initial Cue Values

A newly created media cue usually gets:

- Start time from drop position
- Duration from source media (or default behavior)
- Layer assignment from drop target

### Next Steps After Placement

- Move or trim cue timing
- Add tweens for motion/effects
- Set cue routing/output options if needed
- Test by scrubbing and short playback loops
