## Getting Help

When escalation is needed, gather diagnostics first so support can reproduce and resolve quickly.

### Built-In Support Tools

Use the Help menu to:

- **Create Feedback Report**
- **Open Log Directory**
- Review licensing/version information

### What to Collect

Before contacting support, capture:

- Exact WATCHOUT version/build in use
- Show file name/version
- Steps to reproduce
- Node aliases and roles (Director/Runner/Asset Manager)
- Relevant timestamps and screenshots/video

### Useful Runtime Context

Include whether the issue occurred:

- During local preview or live network playback
- With specific outputs (GPU/SDI/NDI)
- After recent network, driver, or hardware changes

### Team Handoff Tip

Document temporary workarounds in marker cues or operations notes so the next operator can keep the show stable while root-cause analysis continues.
