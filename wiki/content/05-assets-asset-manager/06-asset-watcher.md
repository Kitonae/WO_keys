## Asset Watcher

The Asset Watcher automatically monitors designated folders for new or changed files, streamlining the content workflow.

### Setting Up Watch Folders

- Go to **Settings → Asset Manager**

- Click **Add Watch Folder**

- Browse to the folder you want to monitor

- Configure import options

- Click **OK** to enable watching

### Watch Folder Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Include Subfolders | Monitor subdirectories recursively |
| File Types | Filter which file types to import |
| Target Folder | Where to place imported assets in the show |
| Auto-Delete Source | Remove source after successful import |

### How It Works

- Place new media files in the watched folder

- Asset Watcher detects the new files

- Files are automatically imported into the show

- Optimization begins immediately

- Assets appear in the Assets window when ready

### File Change Detection

If a source file is modified:

- The Asset Watcher detects the change

- The asset is marked as modified (orange icon)

- Re-optimization is triggered automatically

- Updated content is distributed to display servers

### Use Cases

- **Collaborative Workflows** – Content creators drop files for operators

- **Live Updates** – Update content during a show

- **Automated Pipelines** – Integrate with render farms or CMS
