      "Welcome to WATCHOUT 7": "<h2>Welcome to WATCHOUT 7</h2>\n\n<p><strong>WATCHOUT 7</strong> represents the latest evolution of Dataton's award-winning multi-display production and playback system. Created for show creators, live event professionals, and system integrators, WATCHOUT gives you the power to orchestrate massive scale visuals across unlimited displays, projectors, and LED walls, all from a single timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're creating a digital signage installation, a projection mapping spectacle, a live concert background, or a corporate presentation, WATCHOUT provides the tools to compose, manage, and play back high-resolution media with frame-accurate synchronization.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>New in WATCHOUT 7:</strong> This seventh version introduces a completely new high-performance video engine alongside support for <strong>HDR</strong> (High Dynamic Range). You'll also discover a modernized user interface with dark mode, plus enhanced support for asset management and collaborative workflows.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>The Core Concept: One Giant Canvas</h3>\n\n<p>If you're new to multi-display systems, the easiest way to understand WATCHOUT is to think of it as <strong>one giant digital canvas</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine you have a video wall made of ten different screens. In traditional systems, you'd need to create ten separate video files and try to press \"Play\" on ten different players at the exact same time. That approach is difficult and error-prone, requiring constant adjustment to keep everything aligned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WATCHOUT changes this entirely.</strong></p>\n\n<p>With WATCHOUT, you don't worry about individual screens anymore. Instead, you place your media on a <strong>Virtual Stage</strong>—a single, continuous workspace that represents your entire display area. You can drag a video across all ten screens, or have an image float smoothly from the first screen to the last. The whole display becomes one unified creative space.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, WATCHOUT handles the heavy lifting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Producer (Your Desk):</strong> At your desk, you work with the Producer software, where you design your show, arrange media on a Timeline, and animate content. It feels familiar, like editing in standard video software.</li>\n<li><strong>The Display Computers (The Players):</strong> Meanwhile, the Display Computers serve as the workhorses connected to the actual projectors or LED walls.</li>\n<li><strong>The \"Magic\":</strong> Here's where the magic happens: when you run your show, WATCHOUT automatically <strong>slices up your content</strong> in real-time. It sends the correct \"puzzle piece\" of your video to each Display Computer. All computers play their piece in perfect synchronization, so the audience sees one seamless, massive image.</li>\n\n</ul>\nIn short, you design on <strong>one big canvas</strong> while WATCHOUT handles the complexities of splitting it up for your hardware.\n\n<h3>System Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>Technically, WATCHOUT uses a distributed client-server architecture designed for reliability and scalability.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Production Computer</strong></li>\n</ol>\n    Runs the <em>Producer</em> software and manages your project files. This is your creative workstation, where you utilize the new <strong>Asset Manager</strong> to organize content. It performs the control functions (Play, Pause, Update) and synchronizes assets across the network, but leaves the heavy rendering to the displays.\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Display Computers</strong></li>\n</ol>\n    Run the <em>Display</em> software (formerly known as Watchpoint). These machines perform the heavy lifting by decoding video, handling real-time compositing, and rendering to outputs. Each Display Computer automatically synchronizes media from the Production computer and can run \"headless\" without a monitor or keyboard.\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Network</strong></li>\n</ol>\n    The network connects your Production and Display computers via standard Ethernet using TCP/IP.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>UDP Protocol</strong> ensures frame-accurate synchronization.</li>\n<li><strong>TCP Protocol</strong> handles media transfer and system commands.</li>\n    \n</ul>\n    This architecture means you can scale from a simple two-screen setup to hundreds of outputs without changing your workflow.\n\n<h3>What You Can Create</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT is a blank canvas limited only by your hardware and imagination. You might use it to create:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wide-screen Projection:</strong> Blending multiple projectors to form massive panoramic screens that wrap around audiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Projection Mapping:</strong> Allows you to wrap video content around complex 3D physical objects or entire buildings, transforming architecture into dynamic canvases.</li>\n<li><strong>LED Video Walls:</strong> Driving custom resolution LED processors with pixel-perfect accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital Signage:</strong> Installations benefit from synchronized playback across multiple separate monitors throughout a venue, ensuring your message stays coordinated.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Broadcasts:</strong> Gain dynamic backdrops and lower-thirds for broadcast or streaming applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactive Museums:</strong> Can trigger content based on external inputs from sensors, buttons, or network commands.</li>\n\n</ul>\nThe system adapts to your creative vision, whether you're designing an intimate gallery experience or commanding the visual spectacle of a stadium concert.",
      "System Requirements": "<h2>System Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 requires a Windows-based computer with modern hardware to deliver optimal performance. The requirements differ between the Producer computer (where you edit shows) and Display computers (which render and output to projectors/screens).</p>\n\n<h3>Producer vs. Display Computer Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT uses a <strong>client-server architecture</strong> that separates show creation from show playback:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Producer Computer</strong> – This is your creative workstation where you design, edit, and control shows. The Producer software provides the timeline editor, stage view, and all creative tools. You only need <em>one</em> Producer computer per show, and it doesn't need to be connected to any physical outputs—it can preview everything internally. The Producer sends commands and media to Display computers over the network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Display Computer(s)</strong> – These are dedicated playback machines that render content and drive physical outputs (projectors, LED walls, monitors). Each Display computer runs the WATCHOUT Display software and connects to your actual screens. A single Display computer can drive up to 4-8 outputs depending on the graphics card. For larger installations, you simply add more Display computers—WATCHOUT synchronizes them frame-accurately over the network.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can run both Producer and Display on the same computer for small setups or previewing. For production environments, dedicated Display computers ensure reliable, uninterrupted playback.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Producer Computer (Editing)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 10 21H2 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 23H2 or newer (64-bit)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i5 (8th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 5</td><td>Intel Core i7/i9 (12th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 7/9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GB DDR4</td><td>32 GB DDR5 or more</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Graphics</td><td>DirectX 12 compatible GPU with 4 GB VRAM</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 4000 series or AMD Radeon Pro</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storage</td><td>SSD with 100 GB free</td><td>NVMe SSD (Gen4) with 1 TB+ free</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Network</td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td><td>10 Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Display Computer (Playback)</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 10 21H2 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 23H2 or newer (64-bit)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i5 (8th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 5</td><td>Intel Core i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GB DDR4</td><td>32 GB DDR5 or more</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Graphics</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD equivalent</td><td><strong>NVIDIA Quadro RTX / RTX Ada Generation</strong></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Storage</td><td>SATA SSD (500+ MB/s read)</td><td>NVMe SSD (Gen4, 3500+ MB/s read)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Network</td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td><td>10 Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>Windows LTSC vs. Standard Editions</h4>\n\n<p>For display computers in permanent installations, consider using <strong>Windows 10/11 IoT Enterprise LTSC</strong> (Long-Term Servicing Channel) instead of standard Windows editions:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Standard Windows</th><th>Windows LTSC</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Feature updates</td><td>Every 6-12 months</td><td>None (security only)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Support lifecycle</td><td>18-24 months</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Bloatware/Store apps</td><td>Included</td><td>Removed</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cortana/Edge/Xbox</td><td>Included</td><td>Removed</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Forced restarts</td><td>Can occur</td><td>Fully controllable</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Update scheduling</td><td>Limited control</td><td>Complete control</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><strong>Practical benefits of LTSC for display servers:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No surprise updates</strong> – Feature updates won't change system behavior or require reboots during shows</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal background processes</strong> – No Cortana, Xbox Game Bar, or Store apps consuming resources</li>\n<li><strong>Predictable environment</strong> – The OS stays exactly as you configured it for years</li>\n<li><strong>Extended support</strong> – Security patches available for 5+ years without upgrading</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced attack surface</strong> – Fewer pre-installed applications means fewer potential vulnerabilities</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Licensing Note:</strong> Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC requires volume licensing through Microsoft partners and is priced differently than retail Windows. It's designed for embedded and fixed-function devices like kiosks, digital signage, and display servers—making it ideal for WATCHOUT installations.\n</p></div>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Display computers should be dedicated to WATCHOUT playback. Avoid running other applications during live shows to ensure consistent performance.\n\n<p></p></div></p>\n\n<h3>Windows Updates and Rendering Performance</h3>\n\n<p>Keeping Windows up to date is <strong>critical for optimal WATCHOUT performance</strong>. Newer Windows updates deliver significant improvements to rendering stability and visual output quality:</p>\n\n<h4>WDDM (Windows Display Driver Model) Improvements</h4>\n\n<p>Modern Windows versions include updated WDDM drivers that fundamentally improve how the operating system communicates with graphics hardware:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WDDM 3.0+ (Windows 11)</strong> – Reduced latency for frame presentation, better VSync handling, and improved multi-monitor synchronization</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling</strong> – Enables the GPU to directly manage its own video memory scheduling, reducing CPU overhead and eliminating stutter during complex compositions</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Optimized flip model</strong> – Modern swap chain presentation reduces tearing and improves frame pacing for smoother playback</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>DirectX 12 Ultimate Enhancements</h4>\n\n<p>Windows updates continuously improve DirectX 12 capabilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced memory management</strong> – Better VRAM allocation reduces out-of-memory errors with large textures and high-resolution video</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Improved shader compilation</strong> – Faster loading times and reduced hitching during playback</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Multi-adapter support</strong> – Better handling of systems with multiple GPUs</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Multi-Head Output Stability</h4>\n\n<p>For display servers driving multiple outputs, Windows updates are essential:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved EDID handling</strong> – Better detection and configuration of connected displays, especially when using EDID emulators or matrix switches</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Hotplug stability</strong> – Reduced crashes and display resets when cables are connected or disconnected</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Resolution persistence</strong> – Display configurations survive reboots more reliably</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Mosaic/Surround mode fixes</strong> – Critical patches for multi-display spanning configurations</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Security and Reliability</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kernel improvements</strong> – Reduced system crashes and blue screens during extended operation</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Memory leak fixes</strong> – Essential for 24/7 installations where systems run for weeks without restart</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Timer resolution updates</strong> – More accurate timing for frame-perfect synchronization</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always use the latest stable Windows version and cumulative updates. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production show computers.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>NVIDIA Quadro RTX / RTX Ada Professional Graphics</h3>\n\n<p>While consumer GeForce cards can run WATCHOUT, <strong>NVIDIA Quadro RTX and RTX Ada generation professional GPUs</strong> are strongly recommended for display computers in production environments. Here's why:</p>\n\n<h4>Key Benefits of Quadro RTX</h4>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Quadro RTX / RTX Pro</th><th>GeForce RTX</th></tr>\n<tr><td>ECC Memory</td><td>✓ Error-correcting VRAM</td><td>✗ Not available</td></tr>\n<tr><td>TCC Mode</td><td>✓ Compute-optimized mode</td><td>✗ Windows display only</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Sync Connector</td><td>✓ Hardware genlock/framelock</td><td>✗ Software sync only</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Displays Supported</td><td>Up to 4-8 native outputs</td><td>Typically 4 outputs</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10-bit Color</td><td>✓ Full support in all apps</td><td>Limited application support</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Driver Certification</td><td>✓ ISV certified, extended testing</td><td>Game-focused optimization</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Support</td><td>✓ Enterprise driver branches</td><td>Consumer update cycle</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h4>ECC Memory – Preventing Visual Artifacts</h4>\n\n<p>Quadro RTX cards feature <strong>Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory</strong> that automatically detects and corrects single-bit memory errors. This prevents:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Random pixel corruption and visual artifacts during playback</li>\n\n<p><li>Frame buffer corruption during extended operation</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Unexplained crashes in mission-critical installations</li></p>\n\n</ul>\nFor 24/7 installations like museums, permanent exhibits, or broadcast applications, ECC memory is essential for guaranteed visual integrity.\n\n<h4>Quadro Sync and Framelock</h4>\n\n<p>For multi-projector installations requiring perfect synchronization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quadro Sync II cards</strong> enable hardware-level genlock between multiple GPUs and external sync sources</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>Framelock</strong> ensures all outputs across multiple cards/systems swap buffers simultaneously</li></p>\n\n<p><li>Critical for edge-blended panoramas and LED wall installations where frame tearing between panels is visible</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Professional Driver Certification</h4>\n\n<p>Quadro drivers undergo extensive testing and certification:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimal Drivers for Enterprise (ODE)</strong> – Stability-focused drivers with extended testing cycles</li>\n\n<p><li><strong>ISV certifications</strong> – Guaranteed compatibility with professional applications</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Longer support lifecycle</strong> – Enterprise customers receive driver updates for extended periods</li></p>\n\n<p><li><strong>Better regression testing</strong> – Less risk of updates breaking existing functionality</li></p>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Recommended Quadro RTX Models</h4>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Model</th><th>VRAM</th><th>Outputs</th><th>Best For</th></tr>\n<tr><td>RTX A4000</td><td>16 GB</td><td>4× DP 1.4</td><td>Mid-range installations, 4K playback</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RTX A5000</td><td>24 GB</td><td>4× DP 1.4</td><td>High-res content, multiple 4K outputs</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RTX A6000</td><td>48 GB</td><td>4× DP 1.4</td><td>8K content, demanding installations</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RTX 4000 Ada</td><td>20 GB</td><td>4× DP 1.4a</td><td>Latest generation, AV1 decode</td></tr>\n<tr><td>RTX 5000 Ada</td><td>32 GB</td><td>4× DP 1.4a</td><td>Premium performance, future-proof</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For installations requiring more than 4 outputs per machine, consider using multiple Quadro cards with Quadro Sync, or NVIDIA's NVLink bridge technology for unified memory access across GPUs.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Storage Recommendations</h3>\n\n<p>Video playback performance depends heavily on storage speed:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Content Type</th><th>Minimum Read Speed</th><th>Recommended Storage</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Single 4K HAP video</td><td>400 MB/s</td><td>SATA SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Multiple 4K videos</td><td>1500 MB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen3 SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8K content</td><td>3000+ MB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen4 SSD</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Image sequences</td><td>5000+ MB/s</td><td>NVMe Gen4 or RAID array</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Network Requirements</h3>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Component</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Speed</td><td>1 Gbps</td><td>10 Gbps</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Switch</td><td>Managed Gigabit switch</td><td>Enterprise-grade with IGMP snooping</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Cabling</td><td>Cat6</td><td>Cat6a or fiber optic</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Topology</td><td>Star (all on same subnet)</td><td>Dedicated VLAN for WATCHOUT</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>What is IGMP Snooping?</strong> Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping is a switch feature that optimizes multicast traffic. Without it, multicast packets (used by WATCHOUT for synchronization and NDI video) flood all switch ports, wasting bandwidth. With IGMP snooping enabled, the switch intelligently forwards multicast traffic only to devices that need it—reducing network congestion and improving overall performance, especially in systems with multiple display servers or NDI sources.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>File Transfer Time Comparison</h4>\n\n<p>Network speed dramatically affects how quickly you can deploy media to display servers. The table below shows approximate transfer times for common file sizes:</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>File Size</th><th>1 Gbps (~110 MB/s)</th><th>10 Gbps (~1.1 GB/s)</th><th>Time Saved</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1 GB</td><td>~9 seconds</td><td>~1 second</td><td>8 seconds</td></tr>\n<tr><td>100 GB</td><td>~15 minutes</td><td>~90 seconds</td><td>13.5 minutes</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1 TB</td><td>~2.5 hours</td><td>~15 minutes</td><td>2+ hours</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Note:</strong> Actual transfer speeds depend on disk I/O, network congestion, and switch quality. The values above assume modern SSDs and a well-configured network with minimal overhead.\n</p></div>\n\n<p>For productions with large media libraries or frequent content updates, 10 Gbps networking pays for itself quickly in reduced setup and rehearsal time. Consider 10 GbE especially for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4K/8K video content</strong> – Single uncompressed 4K frames can exceed 30 MB</li>\n<li><strong>Image sequences</strong> – Thousands of files that benefit from sustained throughput</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-server deployments</strong> – Simultaneous transfers to multiple display computers</li>\n<li><strong>Live event environments</strong> – Last-minute content changes require rapid deployment</li>\n\n</ul>",
      "Installing WATCHOUT": "<h2>Installing WATCHOUT</h2>\n\n<p>Setting up WATCHOUT represents the first step toward creating your show. The installation process is straightforward, but ensuring your system is prepared correctly is key to a stable performance environment.</p>\n\n<h3>Getting the Installer</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the official Dataton website at <strong>dataton.com/downloads</strong>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>WATCHOUT 7</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Download the latest release installer.</li>\n\n</ol>\n<h3>Installation Process</h3>\n\n<h4>1.

      "Network Configuration": "<h2>Network Configuration</h2>\n\n<p>Establishing a robust and properly configured network is critical for WATCHOUT 7. The system relies on the network not just for file transfer, but for frame-accurate synchronization (UDP) and system control (TCP).</p>\n\n<h3>General Recommendations</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Network:</strong> The WATCHOUT network should be a closed, dedicated local area network (LAN). Do <strong>not</strong> connect it to the internet or a general office network alongside your show data.</li>\n<li><strong>Wired Connections:</strong> Always use wired Ethernet connections (Cat5e, Cat6, or fiber). Wi-Fi is not supported for show synchronization due to latency and packet loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Components:</strong> Invest in reliable, professional-grade networking equipment. Consumer-grade hardware may introduce latency spikes or dropped packets under sustained load.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommended Network Hardware</h3>\n\n<p>Choosing the right hardware ensures stable, low-latency communication between your Production and Display computers.</p>\n\n<h4>Network Switches</h4>\n\n<p>For most WATCHOUT installations, a quality unmanaged gigabit switch is sufficient. However, for larger or more demanding setups, consider managed switches that offer greater control.</p>\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Type</th><th>Use Case</th><th>Recommended Models</th></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Unmanaged Gigabit</strong></td><td>Small to medium shows<br>(2-8 displays)</td><td>Netgear GS108, TP-Link TL-SG108,<br>Cisco CBS110</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>Managed Gigabit</strong></td><td>Medium to large shows,<br>VLANs, QoS</td><td>Cisco CBS250, Netgear GS310TP,<br>Ubiquiti UniFi Switch</td></tr>\n<tr><td><strong>10GbE</strong></td><td>High bandwidth<br>(NDI, 4K+, many outputs)</td><td>Netgear XS508M, MikroTik CRS305,<br>Ubiquiti UniFi 10G</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Disable Power Saving Features:</strong> If using managed switches, disable \"Green Ethernet,\" \"Energy Efficient Ethernet\" (EEE), and any auto-sleep modes. These features can interrupt synchronization and cause stuttering.\n</p></div>\n\n<h4>Network Interface Cards (NICs)</h4>\n\n<p>Built-in motherboard NICs (Intel I211, I225, Realtek RTL8125) are typically adequate. For demanding workflows (10GbE, NDI sources), consider dedicated add-in cards:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intel X550-T2:</strong> Dual-port 10GbE, excellent driver support.</li>\n<li><strong>Mellanox ConnectX-3:</strong> High performance, often used in broadcast environments.</li>\n<li><strong>ASUS XG-C100C:</strong> Cost-effective 10GbE option for smaller budgets.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h4>Cabling</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cat5e:</strong> Suitable for Gigabit Ethernet up to 100 meters.</li>\n<li><strong>Cat6/Cat6a:</strong> Recommended for 10GbE or runs approaching 100 meters with better shielding.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiber Optic (SFP/SFP+):</strong> Essential for long-distance runs (over 100 meters) or electrically noisy environments (near LED walls, dimmers, etc.).</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>IP Addressing</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT computers must be on the same subnet to discover each other. We recommend using static IP addresses to ensure consistent connectivity.</p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Scheme</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subnet Mask:</strong> <code>255.255.255.0</code> (Class C)</li>\n<li><strong>Production Computer:</strong> <code>192.168.1.10</code></li>\n<li><strong>Display Computers:</strong> <code>192.168.1.11</code>, <code>192.168.1.12</code>, etc.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<div class='warning-box'><p><strong>Avoid DHCP:</strong> While WATCHOUT can technically work with auto-assigned IPs (DHCP), it is strongly discouraged for live environments. IPs can change upon reboot, potentially breaking your mapping and control links.\n</p></div>\n\n<h3>Windows Firewall</h3>\n\n<p>WATCHOUT 7 requires specific network ports to operate. Upon installation, the installer typically adds the necessary rules to the Windows Defender Firewall.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to manage ports manually:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TCP Port 3040:</strong> Main communication.</li>\n<li><strong>UDP Port 3040:</strong> Synchronization.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> Various ports are used for the new Asset Manager syncing; ensure the <code>Dataton.Watchout.exe</code> and <code>Dataton.Watchout.Display.exe</code> applications are fully allowed through the firewall for both Private and Public profile types.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<h3>Advanced: Jumbo Frames</h3>\n\n<p>For 10GbE networks or systems pushing very high bandwidth video data (especially NDI or uncompressed streams), enabling <strong>Jumbo Frames</strong> (usually 9000 MTU) on all network cards and switches can improve performance. Ensure every device in the chain supports and is configured for the same MTU size.</p>\n\n<div class='info-box'><p><strong>Testing Tip:</strong> After changing MTU settings, use <code>ping -f -l 8972 <target_ip></code> from a command prompt to verify jumbo frames are working end-to-end.
