## Running Your Show

Running a show reliably is mostly about repeatable procedure. Build a fixed preflight and execution rhythm.

### Preflight (Before Audience)

- Confirm show file/version
- Confirm Director and Asset Manager hosts
- Confirm display routing and test image pass
- Confirm timeline start points and cue logic
- Confirm critical external outputs (if used)

### Live Operation Pattern

1. Place play cursor at planned start.
2. Run timeline.
3. Monitor cue progression and node status.
4. Use pause/jump controls only at rehearsed decision points.

### During-Show Recovery Tactics

- If timing drifts: pause, reposition cursor, and re-run from cue-safe point.
- If one node fails: continue if design allows, then recover during a planned hold.
- If output commands fail: verify network route and cue target settings.

### Post-Show

- Save an archival copy of the final show state.
- Export diagnostics/logs if any incident occurred.
- Document timeline or routing changes made during operation.
