## ArtNet Input

<!-- STUB: This article should cover ArtNet (DMX-over-IP) input for controlling WATCHOUT variables from lighting consoles and DMX controllers. -->

### Content to include

- **What ArtNet input is** — explain that WATCHOUT can receive ArtNet DMX data and map DMX channel values to show variables, allowing lighting consoles to control media server parameters.
- **Enabling ArtNet** — how to enable/disable ArtNet from the Network window toggle.
- **ArtNet channel mapping** — how DMX universe/channel addresses map to WATCHOUT variable external keys. Explain the ArtNet fixture system and channel configuration.
- **ArtNet fixtures** — creating and configuring ArtNet fixtures:
  - Fixture creation and properties.
  - Channel definitions with labels.
  - Physical unit types for channel values.
  - Fixture modes and presets.
- **ArtNet recording** — the ability to record incoming ArtNet data for playback:
  - Starting and stopping recordings.
  - Recording storage and the recording asset type.
  - Playing back recorded ArtNet data as cue content.
  - Discarding recordings.
- **ArtNet output cues** — brief mention that ArtNet fixture cues (covered in Chapter 06) allow timeline-driven ArtNet output, complementing the input capability.
- **Update frequency** — typical ArtNet update rate (~44Hz) and the 50ms interpolation applied to incoming values.
- **Use cases** — lighting desk integration, DMX-controlled opacity/position, recording and playing back lighting sequences.
