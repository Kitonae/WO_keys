## Media Snapshots

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Media Snapshot feature, which allows saving and recalling specific states of cues for quick configuration changes. -->

### Content to include

- **What media snapshots are** — a system for saving the current property state of selected cues as a named preset, and later applying that state to restore or switch cue configurations.
- **Creating a snapshot** — select one or more cues and use the Media Snapshot menu to create a new snapshot. The snapshot captures the current property values of the selected cues.
- **Applying a snapshot** — how to apply a saved snapshot to restore cue properties. Explain which properties are captured and restored.
- **Updating a snapshot** — modifying an existing snapshot to reflect current cue states.
- **Deleting snapshots** — removing individual snapshots or clearing all snapshots.
- **Visual indicators** — the chip/badge indicators on cues and in the top bar showing which snapshots are currently applied, including handling of multiple overlapping snapshots.
- **The "All" toggle** — the toggle for applying/removing all snapshots at once.
- **Use cases** — preset looks for different show segments, quick reset to known-good states, A/B comparison of visual configurations.
