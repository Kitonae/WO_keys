## Customizing Your Workspace

WATCHOUT 7's interface is fully customizable to match your workflow. The flexible window system allows you to arrange, resize, and organize your workspace exactly as you prefer.

### Window Management

#### Moving Windows

Drag any window by its title bar to reposition it within the application. Windows can be placed anywhere on screen and can overlap freely.

#### Resizing Windows

Drag the edges or corners of any window to resize:

*   **Edges** – Resize in one direction
*   **Corners** – Resize in both directions simultaneously

Windows maintain a minimum size to ensure controls remain usable.

#### Closing Windows

Click the × button in any window's title bar, or right-click the title bar and select **Close**.

#### Reopening Windows

Closed windows can be reopened via the **Window** menu:

*   **Window → Stage**
*   **Window → Timeline**
*   **Window → Assets**
*   **Window → Properties**
*   **Window → Network**
*   **Window → Variables** (for show variables/inputs)

### Window Docking

Windows can be **docked** to the edges of the application:

1. Hold `Ctrl` and double-click a window's title bar
2. The window docks to the nearest edge

Docked windows:

*   Stretch to fill the edge
*   Don't overlap other content
*   Stay at their docked position when the application resizes

To undock, hold `Ctrl` and double-click the title bar again.

### Layout Presets

Save and recall up to 9 custom workspace layouts:

#### Saving Presets

*   `Ctrl+Shift+1` through `Ctrl+Shift+9` – Save current layout to preset 1-9

#### Loading Presets

*   `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` – Load layout preset 1-9

Presets remember:

*   Window positions
*   Window sizes
*   Which windows are open
*   Docking states

### Layout Files

For sharing layouts between projects or team members:

#### Save Layout to File

*   **Window → Save Layout** – Export current workspace to a `.layout.json` file

#### Load Layout from File

*   **Window → Load Layout** – Import a workspace from file

### Reset Layout

To restore the default workspace arrangement:

*   **Window → Reset Layout**

This returns all windows to their original positions and sizes.

### Window Navigation

#### Cycling Windows

Navigate between windows using keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Activate next window |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Activate previous window |
| `Ctrl+\`` | Next window of same type |
| `Ctrl+Shift+\`` | Previous window of same type |

#### Direct Window Access

Jump directly to specific windows:

*   **Stage** – Click in background or use **Window → Stage**
*   **Timeline** – **Window → Timelines**
*   **Assets** – **Window → Assets**
*   **Properties** – **Window → Properties** or `Ctrl+P`
*   **Network** – **Window → Network**

### Theme Selection

Toggle between visual themes via **Window → Light Theme**:

*   **Dark Theme** – Reduced brightness for low-light environments
*   **Light Theme** – Higher contrast for bright environments

Your theme preference persists across sessions.

### Multiple Timeline Windows

WATCHOUT supports multiple Timeline windows open simultaneously, useful when working with multiple timelines in your show. Each Timeline window operates independently and can display a different timeline.

### Window Focus Indicators

The active (focused) window displays:

*   Brighter title bar text
*   Enhanced border color
*   Stronger drop shadow

This visual hierarchy helps identify which window receives keyboard input.

### Transparent Stage

The Stage window can display a transparent background when configured, allowing the operating system desktop or other applications to show through. This is useful for:

*   Calibration reference
*   Matching on-screen content with physical elements
*   Presentation previews
