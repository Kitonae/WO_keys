## Understanding the Timeline

The Timeline is where show logic is sequenced. Cues on layers define what plays, when it plays, and how it behaves.

### Core Elements

- **Time ruler**: visual time scale for navigation and placement
- **Play cursor**: current playback/jump position
- **Layers**: stacking order for visual priority
- **Cues**: media or control objects with start and duration
- **Zoom and scroll**: precision editing across long timelines

### Cue Sequences

A timeline can represent:

- A normal timeline
- A composition timeline

Both use the same editing concepts, but compositions are often used as grouped reusable structures.

### Navigation Patterns

- Click the ruler to move time.
- Use arrow-key navigation to step between cues on active layer.
- Use zoom controls (`Numpad +` / `Numpad -`) for fine timing edits.

### Selection Context

The Timeline has context-sensitive behavior:

- Timeline context (global operations)
- Cue context (cue edits)
- Layer context (layer properties)

Shortcuts and menu actions can change behavior depending on which context is active.
