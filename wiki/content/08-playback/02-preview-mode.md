## Preview Mode

Preview mode lets you validate timing, transitions, and composition flow directly in Producer before committing to full system output.

### What to Preview Locally

- Cue timing and transitions
- Tween behavior and motion paths
- Layer and composition logic
- Basic content framing

### Display Previews

WATCHOUT can fetch display preview images for subscribed displays while playback state updates, helping you verify remote output behavior from Producer.

### Preview Limits

Preview is excellent for structure and timing, but final quality checks should still happen on target hardware for:

- Color accuracy
- Brightness/contrast
- Frame pacing under full show load

### Recommended Process

- Use local preview during programming.
- Rehearse on the real network/output path before showtime.
