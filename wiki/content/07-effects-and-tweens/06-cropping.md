## Cropping

Crop tweens animate the visible bounds of a cue and are useful for reveals, wipes, and framing.

### Crop Types

- Crop Top
- Crop Bottom
- Crop Left
- Crop Right
- Crop All (all sides together)

Shortcut for crop-all toggle: `Alt+C`.

### Typical Use Cases

- Directional text/image reveals
- Safe-area adjustments without re-rendering assets
- Dynamic framing across multiple aspect ratios

### Workflow Tips

- Start with one side to define motion intent.
- Combine with opacity for softer reveals.
- Validate crop behavior on real output resolution.
