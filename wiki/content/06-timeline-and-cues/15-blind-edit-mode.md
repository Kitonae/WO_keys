## Blind Edit Mode

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Blind Edit feature, which allows editing timeline content independently of live playback, applying changes only when explicitly committed. -->

### Content to include

- **What Blind Edit is** — explain that Blind Edit mode lets you make changes to a timeline's cues and properties in isolation, without those changes immediately affecting live playback. Changes are staged and applied only when you "Take" (commit) them.
- **Entering Blind Edit mode** — how to enter Blind Edit from the timeline controls or from the Cue List window ("Blind Edit Timeline"). Note the warning dialog when entering Blind Edit on a playing or paused timeline.
- **The Blind Edit toolbar** — describe the Edit/Follow/Take controls:
  - **Edit** — toggle to enter or exit blind edit mode.
  - **Follow** — toggle to keep the blind edit time position in sync with the live playhead.
  - **Take** — apply all staged changes to the live show. Note that Take is disabled when a parent timeline is locked.
- **Editing while in Blind Edit** — cue modifications, tween changes, and property edits are all captured without affecting the running show.
- **Safety warnings** — the warning dialog explaining that applying changes to a playing/paused timeline can yield unexpected results.
- **Use cases** — making adjustments during a live performance without disrupting output, preparing the next look while the current scene plays, correcting errors without stopping the show.
