## Adjusting Timing

Precise timing is central to show quality. WATCHOUT provides direct manipulation and command-based timing edits.

### Common Timing Edits

- Drag cue body to move start time
- Drag cue edges to trim duration
- Use trim commands for exact operations

### Trim and Reset Actions

Available timeline actions include:

- **Trim Start**
- **Trim End**
- **Reset Duration**
- **Reset In-Time**

These are useful when cues need to be quickly normalized after rehearsal changes.

### Snapping

Snapping helps align edits to meaningful points:

- Cue start/end points
- Current play cursor
- Nearby timeline structures

Toggle snapping with `Ctrl+N`.

### Navigation-Assisted Timing

Use keyboard navigation to jump between cues on active layer, then adjust timing without losing selection context.
