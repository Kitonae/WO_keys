## Rotation Effects

Rotation tweens control orientation in 2D and 3D contexts.

### Rotation Axes

WATCHOUT provides:

- **Rotation Z** (`roll`) for classic 2D spin
- **Rotation Y** (`yaw`) for horizontal 3D turn
- **Rotation X** (`pitch`) for vertical 3D tilt

Shortcuts:

- `Alt+Z` for Rotation Z
- `Alt+Y` for Rotation Y

### Practical Uses

- Badge or logo spins
- Card-flip style transitions
- Perspective movement enhancements

### Control Tips

- Keep pivot/anchor placement in mind before animating.
- Large 3D rotations often need complementary position/scale adjustment.
