## Cue Sets and Variants

<!-- STUB: This article should cover the Cue Set system (internally called Cue Groups), which allows cues to have multiple named variants that can be switched between at runtime or during show preparation. -->

### Content to include

- **What cue sets are** — explain that a Cue Set is a named group that can contain multiple variants. Cues assigned to a cue set will render differently depending on which variant is active.
- **Creating a cue set** — using the Cue Sets panel or context menu to create a new set, naming it, and understanding the initial default variant.
- **Managing variants** — adding new variants, duplicating existing variants, renaming variants, setting a default variant, and deleting variants.
- **Assigning cues to cue sets** — how to assign a cue to a specific set and variant via the cue properties "Cue Set" field.
- **Switching the active variant** — how changing the active variant on a set affects all cues assigned to it. Explain the runtime switching behavior.
- **Cue Set column in Cue List** — the Cue Set column in the Cue List window for quick identification.
- **Use cases** — multi-language shows (variant per language), day/night versions, client-specific customizations, rehearsal vs. show configurations.
- **Interaction with asset deletion** — assets used in cue sets cannot be deleted while referenced.
