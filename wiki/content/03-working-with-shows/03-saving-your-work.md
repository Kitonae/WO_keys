## Saving Your Work

Saving in WATCHOUT covers both project state and operational safety. Use frequent saves, especially before network actions or major timeline edits.

### Save Commands

| Command | Shortcut | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Save** | `Ctrl+S` | Update the current show file |
| **Save As...** | `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Create a new show file/path |
| **Save Copy...** | *(menu)* | Snapshot the show without switching the active file |

### Save vs Save As vs Save Copy

- **Save**: Writes changes to the currently open file.
- **Save As**: Writes to a new file and makes it the active show path.
- **Save Copy**: Writes a duplicate for backup/versioning while keeping your current active show unchanged.

### Recommended Workflow

1. Save before connecting to a Director.
2. Save after major edits (display routing, cue timing, grouping).
3. Save a copy before risky operations (bulk cue edits, large asset swaps).

### Team and Versioning Tips

- Use dated file names for milestones, e.g. `Show_v2026-02-08.watch`.
- Keep operator notes in marker/comment cues.
- Store show file and assets under the same project root to simplify handoff.

Recent shows are tracked by Producer, so consistent naming and paths make recovery faster after restarts.
