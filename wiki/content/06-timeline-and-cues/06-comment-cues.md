## Comment Cues

Comment cues (marker cues) provide timeline annotations for operators, programmers, and show callers.

### What Comment Cues Are For

- Scene-change notes
- Technical reminders
- Operator prompts
- Countdown/count-up references

### Creating Comment Cues

- Use **Add Comment/Marker Cue** actions
- Shortcut: `Ctrl+Enter`

### Marker Options

Comment cues can include:

- Description text
- Countdown mode
- Count-up mode
- Marker duration settings

### Best Practices

- Keep marker text short and operational.
- Use consistent prefixes (`LX`, `SFX`, `VFX`, `GO`) when collaborating with show control teams.
- Place markers slightly ahead of critical moments for operator reaction time.
