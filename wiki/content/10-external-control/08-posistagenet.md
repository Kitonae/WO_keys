## PosiStageNet

<!-- STUB: This article should cover PosiStageNet (PSN) integration for receiving position tracking data in WATCHOUT. -->

### Content to include

- **What PosiStageNet is** — a protocol for transmitting 3D position data from tracking systems (BlackTrax, Mo-Sys, etc.) over a network. WATCHOUT can receive PSN data and use it to drive content positioning.
- **Enabling PSN** — how to enable/disable the PosiStageNet protocol from the Network window toggle.
- **PSN data mapping** — how PSN tracker positions map to WATCHOUT variables. Explain the coordinate mapping (X, Y, Z position values becoming variable inputs).
- **Forwarding architecture** — the PosiStage forwarder component and how it relays data to the Director.
- **Use cases** — content that follows performers on stage, interactive projection mapping, position-reactive show elements.
- **Requirements** — a compatible tracking system sending PSN data, network connectivity between the tracking system and the WATCHOUT Operative.
