## Connecting Devices

### Automatic Discovery

WATCHOUT uses multicast discovery. All devices on the same subnet automatically find each other.

### Troubleshooting Connection

- Verify all devices have valid IP addresses in the same subnet

- Check that multicast traffic is not blocked

- Disable any WiFi connections on WATCHOUT computers
