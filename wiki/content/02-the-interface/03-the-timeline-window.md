## The Timeline Window

The **Timeline** is where you orchestrate your show—arranging media and controlling precisely when things happen. It provides a horizontal time-based view of your content, organized in layers.

### Timeline Structure

The Timeline window is divided into several key areas:

#### Header Area

*   **Timecode Display** – Shows the current playback position in hours:minutes:seconds:frames format. Click to jump to a specific time.
*   **Sync Indicator** – Displays synchronization status with the Director
*   **Cue Status Line** – Shows information about selected cues
*   **Countdown Display** – Indicates time remaining until the next pause cue

#### Layer Headers

The left column displays layer names. Each layer is a horizontal track for organizing content:

*   **Layer Name** – Custom name or default "Layer N" numbering
*   **Key and Fill Mode** – Icon indicates if a layer uses luma or alpha keying
*   **Selection Highlight** – Active layer appears with elevated background

Layers are ordered with higher numbers appearing on top in the Stage view.

#### Time Ruler

The horizontal ruler at the top of the cue area shows time in your configured format. Features include:

*   **Time Markings** – Major and minor divisions based on zoom level
*   **Play Cursor Indicator** – Triangle marker showing current time
*   **Click to Jump** – Click in the ruler to move the play cursor (when "Click Jumps to Time" is enabled)

#### Cue Area

The main workspace where cues are displayed:

*   **Tracks** – Horizontal lanes corresponding to layers
*   **Cues** – Colored rectangles representing media and control cues
*   **Play Cursor** – Vertical red line showing current playback position
*   **Overlap Indicators** – Cues that overlap in time on the same layer show warning styling

#### Tween Curves Panel

When a media cue is selected, the lower panel displays animation curves showing how properties change over time.

#### Minimap

The bottom bar shows a compressed overview of your entire timeline, with:

*   **Visible Range Indicator** – Shows which portion of the timeline is currently displayed
*   **Pan Control** – Drag to scroll horizontally
*   **Play Position** – Small indicator of current playback time
*   **Cue Overview** – Tiny representations of all cues
