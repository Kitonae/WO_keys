## Blur Effects

WATCHOUT provides a **Gaussian Blur** tween for softening and defocusing content over time.

### Add Blur

- Use Effect menu blur action
- Shortcut: `Alt+B`

### Creative Uses

- Focus pulls between foreground/background layers
- Transition smoothing
- Stylized intro/outro looks

### Performance Guidance

Blur is GPU-intensive in large compositions. If performance drops:

- Reduce overlapping blurred cues
- Shorten blur-heavy sections
- Pre-render where possible for mission-critical playback
