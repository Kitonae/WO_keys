## Asset Manager

The Asset Manager runs as a background service and provides:

- **Centralized Storage** – All media files are managed from a single location

- **Automatic Optimization** – Video files are transcoded to optimal playback formats

- **Version Tracking** – Changes to source files are detected and handled

### Assets Window

The Assets window displays all media in your show. Access it from **Window → Assets** or press `Ctrl+2`.

### Adding Assets

- **Drag and Drop** – Drag files directly from Windows Explorer into the Assets window

- **Menu** – Use **Media → Add Media File** or **Add Image Sequence**

- **Right-Click** – Right-click in the Assets window and choose **Add Media**

- **Asset Watcher** – Automatically import from watched folders

### Asset Organization
