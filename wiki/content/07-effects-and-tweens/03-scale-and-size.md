## Scale and Size

Scale controls cue size over time and can be driven by tween points or static cue settings.

### Scale Modes

WATCHOUT supports multiple scaling strategies in cue properties, including:

- Scale to explicit size
- Scale by factor
- Media-based scaling behavior

### Scale Tweens

Use **Scale** tween actions (shortcut `Alt+S`) to animate growth/shrink effects.

### Common Use Cases

- Pop-in titles
- Slow zoom emphasis
- Scale-matched transitions between scenes

### Tips

- Keep aspect behavior consistent across related cues.
- Check final pixel sharpness on target output, not only in workstation preview.
