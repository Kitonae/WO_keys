## Welcome to WATCHOUT 7

**WATCHOUT 7** is the latest evolution of Dataton's award-winning multi-display production and playback system. Designed for show creators, live event professionals, and system integrators, WATCHOUT empowers you to orchestrate massive-scale visuals across unlimited displays, projectors, and LED walls—all from a single timeline.

Whether you are creating a digital signage installation, a projection mapping spectacle, a live concert background, or a corporate presentation, WATCHOUT provides the tools to compose, manage, and play back high-resolution media with frame-accurate synchronization.

### The Core Concept: One Giant Canvas

If you are new to multi-display systems, the easiest way to understand WATCHOUT is to think of it as **one giant digital canvas**.

In traditional systems with a ten-screen video wall, you might need ten separate video files and players. WATCHOUT eliminates this complexity.

With WATCHOUT, you place your media on a **Stage**—a continuous workspace representing your entire display area. You can drag a video across all screens or animate an image from one side to the other. The system treats the entire display arrangement as a unified creative space.

Behind the scenes, WATCHOUT handles the processing:

*   **Producer:** You use the **Producer** software to design your show, arrange media on the Timeline, and animate content.
*   **Display Computers:** These computers connect to your projectors or LED walls and render the content.
*   **The Playback:** When you run your show, WATCHOUT automatically slices your content in real-time, sending the correct portion to each Display Computer. All computers play in perfect synchronization, creating a seamless image.

### System Architecture

WATCHOUT uses a distributed client-server architecture designed for reliability and scalability.

1.  **Production Computer:** Runs the **Producer** software and manages your project files. This is your creative workstation where you organize content using the **Asset Manager**. It sends control commands (Play, Pause, Update) to the network while leaving heavy rendering to the display computers.
2.  **Display Computers:** Run the **Display** software (formerly Watchpoint). These machines handle video decoding, real-time compositing, and rendering. Each Display Computer synchronizes automatically with the Production Computer and can run "headless" (without a monitor).
3.  **Network:** Connects your Production and Display computers via standard Ethernet.

This architecture allows you to scale from a simple two-screen setup to hundreds of outputs without changing your workflow.

### What You Can Create

WATCHOUT is a blank canvas limited only by your hardware and imagination. Common applications include:

*   **Wide-screen Projection:** Blends multiple projectors to form massive panoramic screens.
*   **Projection Mapping:** Wraps video content around complex 3D objects or buildings.
*   **LED Video Walls:** Drives custom-resolution LED processors with pixel-perfect accuracy.
*   **Digital Signage:** Synchronizes playback across multiple monitors throughout a venue.
*   **Live Broadcasts:** Provides dynamic backdrops and lower-thirds for broadcast or streaming.
*   **Interactive Installations:** Triggers content based on external inputs from sensors, buttons, or network commands.

The system adapts to your creative vision, whether you are designing an intimate gallery experience or a stadium concert.
