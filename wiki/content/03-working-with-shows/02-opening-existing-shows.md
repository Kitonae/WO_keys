## Opening Existing Shows

Most of your time in WATCHOUT will be spent working on shows that already exist—whether you created them yourself in an earlier session or received them from a colleague. The application provides several ways to return to previous work, each suited to different situations.

### Opening from Disk

The most common method is opening a show file directly from your computer's storage. Choose **File → Open** or press `Ctrl+O` to browse for a show file. WATCHOUT's file dialog filters for its native show format, making it easy to locate the correct file among other project assets.

For shows you've worked on recently, **File → Open Recent** provides quick access without navigating through folders. Producer remembers your recent show history, so returning to yesterday's work typically requires just two clicks.

### Opening from a Director

Sometimes the show you want to work on isn't stored locally—it's already running on a Director node elsewhere on the network. In these situations, use **File → Open Show from Director** to connect directly to the running production.

This approach proves valuable when you need to take over programming responsibilities on an existing system. Rather than transferring files and risking version mismatches, you connect straight to the live show data. The same method works well when verifying show state before a performance or when handing off between operators during a multi-day event.

The Welcome Screen also offers connection options for Director-hosted shows, letting you choose between starting fresh locally or joining an existing network session.

### Protecting Unsaved Work

WATCHOUT guards against accidental data loss when switching between shows. If your current show contains unsaved changes and you attempt to open a different one, the application pauses to ask what you'd like to do. You can save your current work, proceed without saving (abandoning recent edits), or cancel the operation entirely and remain in your current show.

This protection applies regardless of how you're opening the new show—whether from disk, from a Director, or via the recent files list.

### Director Override Warnings

When opening a show from a Director that's already running a different production, WATCHOUT displays a prominent warning. Proceeding with the operation will replace the currently running show with the one you're opening, which could interrupt playback or affect displays that are actively showing content.

In rehearsal environments this is typically acceptable, but during live performances such an override could be disruptive. The warning ensures you always make this choice deliberately rather than accidentally.
