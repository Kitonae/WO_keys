## Grouping Cues

Grouping lets you treat multiple cues as a single composition unit.

### Why Group Cues

Use grouping to:

- Reuse complex multi-cue moments
- Keep large timelines manageable
- Apply structure for team collaboration

### Group / Ungroup Operations

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Group selected cues | `Ctrl+G` |
| Ungroup selected cues | `Ctrl+Shift+G` |

Grouped cues become composition-like structures you can manage independently.

### Practical Workflow

1. Build and test the cue cluster.
2. Group when behavior is stable.
3. Name the resulting composition clearly.
4. Avoid frequent regrouping late in production unless necessary.

### Important Note

Some stage operations (such as projector-mode workflows) are restricted while working in composition-focused contexts. Plan mapping work in the main stage context when needed.
